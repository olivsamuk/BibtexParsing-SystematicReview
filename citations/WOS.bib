Abstract = {The problem of stealthy attacks for partially-observed discrete event
   systems is considered. An operator observes the plant through an
   observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of
   certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted by an
   intruder who can insert and erase some sensor readings. We construct an
   attack structure A which guarantees that, when the plant reaches an
   unsafe state, A can make the operator think that the plant is in a safe
   state. Based on A, we can obtain a stealthy attack structure A(s) by
   simply removing from A all the exposing states, all the weakly exposing
   states and their input and output arcs. The stealthy attack structure
   A(s) only contains the possible attacks that can not be detected by the
   operator.},

Title = {Joint State Estimation Under Attack of Discrete Event Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {168068-168079},
Abstract = {The problem of state estimation in the setting of partially-observed
   discrete event systems subject to cyber attacks is considered. An
   operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the
   occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of
   estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted
   by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors
   thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of
   the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator.
   An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of
   all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is
   obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker
   observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each
   possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the
   set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of
   states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can
   be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a
   misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which
   the attacker may insert at most n events between two consecutive
   observations.},

Abstract = {With the rapid growth of cyber-physical systems (CPS), the requirements
   on the security of such systems increases, since the communication
   networks between the controllers, actuators and sensors are vulnerable
   to attacks. In this paper, a detection method for cyber attacks on CPSs
   modeled by discrete event systems is proposed. Deception attacks hide
   their influence and are particular challenging to detect. Two such
   attacks are replay attack and covert attack. The modeling and detection
   of these two attack types is presented. We introduce permutation
   matrices which alter the transmitted signals to disrupt the attack and
   allow the detection. The proposed approach is illustrated by a
   laboratory manufacturing system. (C) 2018, IFAC (International

Title = {<p>Robust decentralized diagnosability of networked discrete event
   systems against DoS and deception attacks</p>},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Denial-of-Service (DoS) are attacks conducted by malicious agents that
   consists in disrupting, temporally or indefinitely, the services
   provided by a communication network. When a malicious agent gets access
   to some network node, it may also perform deception attacks by inserting
   valid packets with fake information into vulnerable channels. We
   address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that
   flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss
   of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their
   implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete
   event systems (NDES). To this end, we propose an automaton model for
   NDES subject to DoS-D attacks that represents the adverse effects of
   DoS-D attacks on the observations of local diagnosers. We introduce a
   new codiagnosability definition called DoS-D-robust codiagnosability,
   and present a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be
   DoS-D-robustly codiagnosable. We also propose a verification algorithm
   for regular languages to check DoS-D-robust codiagnosability. (C)\&

Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a key technology in the
   development of distributed and autonomous large scale systems. However,
   one of their undesirable side effects is the fact that they are
   particularly exposed to cyber attacks carried out by malicious
   intruders. Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in
   high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in
   the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by
   finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can
   be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack
   dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we
   address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such
   is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack
   dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack
   detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or
   fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the
   plant under attack.},

Abstract = {Cybersecurity in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a crucial problem,
   as recent history has shown. A notable characteristic of ICS, compared
   to Information Technology, is the necessity to take into account the
   physical process, and its specific dynamics and effects on the
   environment, when considering cybersecurity issues. Intrusion Detection
   Systems have been studied extensively. In our work, we address the less
   classic topic of response mechanisms, and their automation in a
   self-protection feedback loop. More precisely, we address
   self-protection seen as resilience, where the functionality of the
   system is maintained under attacks, be it in a degraded mode. We model
   this as a Discrete Event Systems supervisory control problem, involving
   a model of the plant's possible behaviors, a model of considered
   attacks, and a formulation of the control objectives. We consider a case
   study, and perform a prototype implementation and simulation, using the
   Heptagon/BZR programming language and compiler/code generator, and
   targeting a multi-PLC experimental platform. Copyright (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the context of
   the supervisory control layer. Specifically, we propose a general model
   of a CPS attacker in the framework of discrete event systems and
   investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given
   feedback control system. Our model captures a class of deception
   attacks, where the attacker has the ability to hijack a subset of sensor
   readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the
   system into an undesirable state. We utilize a game-like discrete
   transition structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA),
   to capture the interaction between the supervisor and the environment
   (which includes the system and the attacker). We show how to use IDAs to
   synthesize three different types of successful stealthy attacks, i.e.,
   attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the
   system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This work is set in the context of supervisory control of discrete-event
   systems under partial observation. Attackers that are able to insert or
   erase occurrences of particular output symbols can tamper with the
   supervisor's observation and by doing so, can lead the controlled system
   to undesirable states. We consider a scenario with multiple attackers,
   each one being an element of a set, called the attack set. We also
   assume that only one of the attackers within an attack set is acting,
   although we don't know which one. According to previous results in the
   literature, a supervisor that enforces a given legal language,
   regardless of which attacker is acting, can be designed if the legal
   language is controllable and satisfies a property called P-observability
   for an attack set. The latter is an extended notion of observability and
   is related with the supervisor's ability to always distinguish between
   outputs that require different control actions, even if the outputs were
   attacked. We present a new approach for checking if a given language is
   P-observable for an attack set, by first introducing a visual
   representation as well as some definitions that capture the attack's
   effect. Additionally, we present two algorithms that together allow us
   to verify if a given language is P-observable for an attack set, when it
   is represented as an automaton.},

Abstract = {We consider a multi-adversary version of the supervisory control problem
   for discrete-event systems (DES), in which an adversary corrupts the
   observations available to the supervisor. The supervisor's goal is to
   enforce a specific language in spite of the opponent's actions and
   without knowing which adversary it is playing against. This problem is
   motivated by applications to computer security in which a cyber defense
   system must make decisions based on reports from sensors that may have
   been tampered with by an attacker. We start by showing that the problem
   has a solution if and only if the desired language is controllable (in
   the DES classical sense) and observable in a (novel) sense that takes
   the adversaries into account. For the particular case of attacks that
   insert symbols into or remove symbols from the sequence of sensor
   outputs, we show that testing the existence of a supervisor and building
   the supervisor can be done using tools developed for the classical DES
   supervisory control problem, by considering a family of automata with
   modified output maps, but without expanding the size of the state space
   and without incurring on exponential complexity on the number of attacks
   considered.},

Abstract = {Resilience is a critical criterion to evaluate a networked system
   including discrete-event systems (DESs). This research touches upon the
   supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets
   under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into
   actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of
   an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that
   enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a
   sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different
   types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of
   transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and
   disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a
   state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a
   modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we
   assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the
   attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption.
   Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible
   transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under
   attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the
   specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two
   transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification
   simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product
   observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its
   specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor
   by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular
   condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated
   through examples.

   additional attacks and attack features reported in recent security
   incidents. We study the supervisory control problem in cases when
   attacks occur: (i) only on the sensors, (ii) only on the actuators, and
   (iii) both on the actuators and sensors of the plant. For each case, we
   present new sets of controllability theorems and synthesizing algorithms
   for attack-resilient supervisors. On a series of examples, we illustrate
   the use of our approach for modeling and design of such security-aware
   supervisory control.},

Abstract = {In this work, we shall investigate the problem of covert attacker
   synthesis in the framework of supervisory control of discrete-event
   systems. Intuitively, the covertness property says that the attacker
   cannot reach a situation where its existence has been detected by the
   supervisor while no damage can be caused. We consider covert attackers
   that can exercise both actuator attacks (including enablement attacks
   and disablement attacks) and sensor attacks (restricted to sensor
   replacement attacks), where the (partial-observation) attackers may or
   may not eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We
   shall develop an exponential time reduction from the covert attacker
   synthesis problem to the well studied Ramadge-Wonham supervisor
   synthesis problem, which generalizes our previous work on a reduction
   based approach for covert actuator attacker synthesis, for both the
   damage reachable goal and the damage-nonblocking goal. We also provide
   discussions on conditions under which the exponential blowup in state
   sizes, due to the reduction construction, can be avoided. (C) 2021

   discrete-event systems. We assume the actuator attacker partially
   observes the execution of the closed-loop system and eavesdrops the
   control commands issued by the supervisor. The attacker can modify each
   control command on a specified subset of attackable events. The goal of
   the actuator attacker is to remain covert until it can establish a
   successful attack and lead the attacked closed-loop system into
   generating certain damaging strings. We then present a characterization
   for the existence of a successful attacker and prove the existence of
   the supremal successful attacker, when both the supervisor and the
   attacker are normal. Finally, we present an algorithm to synthesize the
   supremal successful normal attackers.},

Abstract = {Cyber-attack models and their respective mitigation strategies have been
   recently studied in the discrete event systems setting. Previous work
   focuses on whether unsafe behaviour can be prevented using supervisory
   control theory. When unsafe behaviour cannot be prevented with
   certainty, mitigation strategies are limited. This paper proposes the
   use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to
   incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack
   models presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The least-unsafe (LU)
   supervisor problem is introduced to minimize this unsafe likelihood
   measure and improve existing attack mitigation techniques. The LU
   supervisor problem under full observability is solved by reformulating
   it into an MDP problem, and a computable algorithm is developed. Lastly,
   the implementation of LU supervisors is discussed and illustrated with
   an example. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we shall formulate and address a problem of covert
   actuator attacker synthesis for cyber-physical systems that are modeled
   by discrete-event systems. We assume the actuator attacker partially
   observes the execution of the closed-loop system and is able to modify
   each control command issued by the supervisor on a specified attackable
   subset of controllable events. We provide straightforward but in general
   exponential-time reductions, due to the use of subset construction
   procedure, from the covert actuator attacker synthesis problems to the
   Ramadge-Wonham supervisor synthesis problems. It then follows that it is
   possible to use the many techniques and tools already developed for
   solving the supervisor synthesis problem to solve the covert actuator
   attacker synthesis problem for free. In particular, we show that, if the
   attacker cannot attack unobservable events to the supervisor, then the
   reductions can be carried out in polynomial time. We also provide a
   brief discussion on some other conditions under which the exponential
   blowup in state size can be avoided. Finally, we show how the reduction
   based synthesis procedure can be extended for the synthesis of
   successful covert actuator attackers that also eavesdrop the control
   commands issued by the supervisor.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the robust control problem of discrete event
   systems assuming that replacement attacks may occur, thus making it
   appear that an event that has occurred looks like another event. In
   particular, we assume that this is done by tampering with the
   sensor-readings in the sensor communication channel. Specifically, we
   use Petri nets as the reference formalism to model the plant and assume
   a control specification in terms of a generalized mutual exclusion
   constraint. We propose three different methods to derive a control
   policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two
   methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are
   computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems. On the
   contrary, the third method computes a policy more efficiently and
   reveals more easily implementable in practice. However, this is done at
   the expense of optimality.},

Abstract = {Security administrators of companies and organizations need to come up
   with proper countermeasures against cyber-attacks considering
   infrastructures and security policies in their possession. In order to
   develop and verify such countermeasures, the administrators should be
   able to reenact both cyber-attacks and defenses. Simulations can be
   useful for the reenactment by overcoming its limitations including high
   risk and cost. If the administrators are able to design various
   scenarios of cyber-attacks and to develop simulation models from their
   viewpoints, they can simulate desired situations and observe the results
   more easily. It is challenging to simulate cyber-security issues,
   because there is lack of theoretical basis for modeling a wide range of
   the security field as well as pre-defined basic components used to model
   cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a modeling method for
   cyber-security simulations by developing a basic component and a
   composite model, called Abstracted Cyber-Security Unit Model (ACSUM) and
   Abstracted Cyber-security SIMulation model (ACSIM), respectively. The
   proposed models are based on DEVS(Discrete Event systems Specification)
   formalism, a modeling theory for discrete event simulations. We develop
   attack scenarios by sequencing attack behaviors using ACSUMs and then
   model ACSIMs by combining and abstracting the ACSUMs from a security
   perspective. The concepts of ACSUM and ACSIM enable the security
   administrators to simulate numerous cyber-security issues from their
   viewpoints. As a case study, we model a worm scenario using ACSUM and
   simulate three types of simulation models based on ACSIM from a
   different security perspective.},

Abstract = {Due to insecure network-based communications, cyber-physical systems
   face the risks of cyber attacks which might result in catastrophic
   damage. This paper provides an overview of existing approaches
   preventing damage caused by cyber attacks in the supervisory control of
   cyber-physical systems. The objective is to identify missing pieces,
   possible links and determine new directions for further research to
   improve the existing literature. For this purpose, first, we classify
   the current research works under a framework consisting of three
   dimensions: 1) the communication channel where an attack can happen, 2)
   the attack impact on the transmitted data, and 3) the mechanism to
   prevent damage. This classification will then help us to compare the
   existing techniques and investigate how they can be improved to get
   closer to the ideal scenario where most kinds of attacks can be handled
   so that the closed-loop system remains safe.},

Abstract = {The deployment of control systems with network-connected components has
   made feedback control systems vulnerable to attacks over the network.
   This paper considers the problem of intrusion detection and mitigation
   in supervisory control systems, where the attacker has the ability to
   enable or disable vulnerable actuator commands and erase or insert
   vulnerable sensor readings. We present a mathematical model for the
   system under certain classes of actuator enablement attacks, sensor
   erasure attacks, or sensor insertion attacks. We then propose a defense
   strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all
   controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an
   algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent
   damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy,
   where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of
   unsafe system states. The technical condition of interest that is
   necessary and sufficient in this context, termed ``GF-safe
   controllability{''}, is characterized. We show that the verification of
   GF-safe controllability can be performed using diagnoser or verifier
   automata. Finally, we illustrate the methodology with a traffic control
   system example. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of the major challenges about cyber physical systems is how to
   prevent cyber attacks to ensure system integrity. There has been a large
   number of different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and
   computer science communities. In this paper we aim to investigate one
   special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an

Abstract = {One of the major challenges about cyber-physical systems is how to
   protect system integrity from cyber attacks. There has been a large
   number of different types of attacks discussed in the literature. In
   this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the
   discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter
   sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system, aiming to
   trick a given supervisor to issue improper control commands, which can
   drive the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber
   attack problem from an attacker's point of view, and formulate an
   attack-with-bounded-sensor-reading-alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then
   show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be
   computed, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are
   regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the
   synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which
   computes a supervisor that is ABSRA-robust in the sense that any ABSRA
   will either be detectable or inflict no damage to the system. (C) 2018

   components are modifiable and trainable for different applications. Such

   components makes it easier to adapt to varying behaviors due to the

Abstract = {We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) where sensors are
   subject to cyber-attacks. Specifically, we consider CPS control systems
   where sensor readings may be compromised by a malicious attacker intent
   on causing damage to the system. We study this problem at the
   supervisory layer of the control system, using discrete event systems
   techniques. We assume that the attacker can edit the outputs from the
   sensors of the system before they reach the supervisory controller.
   In the first step, we consider the problem from the viewpoint of the
   attacker, where the goal is to use edit attacks on the sensor readings
   to steer the system to an unsafe state without being detected. In the
   second step, we consider defense mechanisms and formulate the problem of
   synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large class of edit
   attacks.
   We present solution methodologies to these two problems that blend
   algorithmic techniques from games on automata with imperfect information
   with results from supervisory control theory of partially observed
   discrete event systems. We discuss the scalability of these algorithms
   in the context of a case study. {[}Joint work with: Romulo Meira-Goes,

Abstract = {There is a lot of growth in Wi-Fi technology, that has given rise to
   Internet access without the need of wires. In IEEE 802.11 protocol, many
   vulnerabilities are present at the MAC layer which give rise to a lot of
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this manuscript we mainly
   concentrate on de-authentication DoS attack in Wi-Fi Networks. The
   victim station get disconnects from the network due to the
   de-authentication DoS attack. Minimum resources are required to launch
   the de-authentication attack. However, the schemes for detecting the
   de-authentication DoS attack suffer from major drawbacks namely, require
   protocol modification, require firmware upgradation, no proof of
   correctness etc. To acknowledge these issues, a Discrete Event System
   (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detection of
   de-authentication attack is proposed.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose and address the problem of supervisor
   obfuscation against actuator enablement attack, in a common setting
   where the actuator attacker can eavesdrop the control commands issued by
   the supervisor. We propose a method to obfuscate an (insecure)
   supervisor to make it resilient against actuator enablement attack in
   such a way that the behavior of the original closed-loop system is
   preserved. An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it
   exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the
   set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our
   approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a
   formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors
   as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under
   controllability and observability constraints, which can be tackled by
   using SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for
   the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality
   assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors.},

Abstract = {Communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators,
   and controllers to monitor and control cyber-physical systems (CPS). The
   use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of the CPS to
   cyber attacks that can drive the system to reach unsafe states. One of
   the most powerful cyber attacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle
   attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create or replace
   information in the attacked network channel. In a previous paper, we
   have introduced the definition of NA-Safe controllability, that is
   related with the capability of detecting intrusions and preventing
   damages caused by man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control
   communication channels in supervisory control systems. In this paper, we
   extend our previous work as follows: (i) we prove the correctness of the
   NA-Safe controllability verification algorithm; (ii) we show how to
   implement the security module against cyber attacks; (iii) we show that
   NA-Safe controllability is a necessary and sufficient condition for the
   existence of the security module; and (iv) we present a practical
   example to illustrate the results of the paper.},

Abstract = {We propose a communication-free control protocol for the coordination of
   multi-agent systems of autonomous vehicles. We consider a maze solving
   problem in which two agents must search an unknown maze as fast and as
   securely as possible. We formulate this problem using a discrete-event
   systems framework and present a coordination strategy for two agents to
   search a simple maze that involves no communication, thereby eliminating
   any cyber-security threats. Our strategy involves two agents having
   reverse priority decision-making policies, while searching the maze with
   a depth-first search control policy. Under our definition of
   inefficiency, which is a function of the number of dead end states that
   are searched by both agents, we show that our method achieves the
   minimum inefficiency cost, and thus performs as well as any
   communication-based solution. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new notion of switched supervisory control
   in the context of discrete event systems. We assume a single
   event-driven system (plant) controlled by a set of supervisors, where
   each pair plant/supervisor generates a different event-driven system. A
   switching mechanism coordinates which plant/supervisor is active at a
   given time. We investigate the problem of synthesizing a set of
   supervisors and a switching mechanism such that safety, liveness and
   maximal permissiveness specifications are satisfied. Sufficient and
   necessary conditions to solve this problem are presented. Second, a
   direct application of this new switched supervisory control theory is
   provided in the context of cyber-security. Namely, this new framework is
   used as basis for a Moving Target Defense paradigm. Again, sufficient
   and necessary conditions to solve this problem are presented. Copyright

Abstract = {Wi-Fi technology has seen rapid growth in the last two decades. It has
   revolutionized the way we access the Internet. However, they are
   vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue
   Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack,
   the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures
   client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by
   spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a
   client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its
   communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise
   credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching
   AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a
   network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and
   maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some
   even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and
   practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of
   correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System
   (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin
   attacks in a Wi-Fi network.},

Abstract = {Due to the rapid increase in digitalization and networking of systems,
   especially in industrial environments, the number of cyber-physical
   systems is increasing and thus the danger of possible attacks on such
   systems. As demonstrated in several recent examples, a cyber attack on
   an industrial control system (ICS) can have catastrophic consequences
   for humans and machines. This is due to the communication networks
   between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors,
   which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or
   devices that are not sufficiently protected. In this paper, two possible
   attacks on a discrete event system (DES) are introduced, in which a
   running process, controlled by a PLC, is manipulated without being
   detected. Furthermore, a detection method for such attacks is presented.},

Abstract = {The problem of stealthy sensor attacks for labeled Petri nets is
   considered. An operator observes the plant to establish if a set of
   critical markings has been reached. The attacker can corrupt the sensor
   channels that transmit the sensor readings, making the operator
   incapable to establish when a critical marking is reached. We first
   construct the stealthy attack Petri net that keeps into account the real
   plant evolutions observed by the attacker and the corrupted plant
   evolutions observed by the operator. Starting from the reachability
   graph of the stealthy attack Petri net, an attack structure is defined:
   it describes all possible attacks. The supremal stealthy attack
   substructure can be obtained by appropriately trimming the attack
   structure. An attack function is effective if the supremal stealthy
   attack substructure contains a state whose first element is a critical
   marking and the second element is a noncritical marking. Copyright (C)

Title = {Usability aware secret protection with minimum cost},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper we study a cybersecurity problem of protecting system's
   secrets with multiple protections and a required security level, while
   minimizing the associated cost due to implementation/maintenance of
   these protections as well as the affected system usability. The target
   system is modeled as a discrete-event system (DES) in which there are a
   subset of marker states denoting the services/functions provided to
   regular users, a subset of secret states, and multiple subsets of
   protectable events with different security levels. We first introduce
   usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then
   formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory
   that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable
   events with at least a certain security level, and the highest
   usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide
   a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem
   is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to
   solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES.
   Moreover, we extend the problem to the case of heterogeneous secrets
   with different levels of importance, and develop an algorithm to solve
   this extended problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   solutions with a network security example. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are increasingly deployed in critical
   infrastructures. Originally designed to increase the productivity of ICS
   as well as safety and reliability, nowadays these systems are becoming
   the target of hackers. Several attacks highlighted vulnerabilities, the
   most relevant one, Stuxnet, stroke in 2010. Protection of ICS against
   cyberattacks has to be considered. Security of these systems is
   different from IT security solutions because exchanged data have
   physical consequences. For that, a new approach for Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) in ICS was presented based on filters monitoring orders and
   reports. Methodology to obtain these filters and their locations in the
   ICS architecture were introduced. In this paper, we present major
   improvements in detection mechanisms of these filters. Distance concept,
   introduced in previous paper (Sicard et al., 2017), is developed and
   combined to trajectory concept that allows filters to detect deviations
   from expected behavior. Distance from optimal or forbidden states is
   essential to compute order sequence bringing back the system into safe
   states. Trajectory, which is the evolution of distance during state
   evolution, improves detection mechanism by analyzing sequences sent to
   the system and received by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This
   combinational security prevents damages against goods and people.
   Implementation of time based intrusion detection is a step forward for
   improving filters. Temporal windows indicate when actions have to be
   done and if received reports correspond to executed orders. Thus, our
   filter approach secures ICS against combinational and temporal attacks
   affecting security of goods and people or quality. (C) 2018, IFAC

Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of physical processes that are
   controlled or monitored by software and communication capabilities.
   Sensors and actuators are elements of CPS that can be vulnerable to
   attacks. Sensor attacks typically consist in corrupting or hiding
   information received from sensors, or creating nonexisting information.
   Actuator attacks typically consist in intercepting and modifying orders
   sent to actuators. Attacks may lead to serious situations that we will
   call failures. We adopt a discrete event system (DES) approach, where
   information received from sensors and actions realized by actuators are
   represented as discrete events. We first develop a model of the attacked
   system using supervisory control of DES. Then, we study the defense
   viewpoint, where we develop methods to detect attacks and avoid
   failures, and determine conditions of attack detectability and failure
   avoidability. Then, we study the attacker's viewpoint, where we develop
   a strategy based on supervisory control of DES to make the attacker
   undetectable.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detection and prevention of cyber
   attacks in discrete event systems where the supervisor communicates with
   the plant via network channels. Random control delays may occur in such
   networked systems, hence the control of the supervisor could be
   affected. Furthermore, there is an attacker targeting the vulnerable
   actuators. The attacker can corrupt the control input generated by the
   supervisor, and aims at driving the plant to unsafe states. We propose a
   new approach to model the closed-loop system subject to control delays
   and attacks. The notion of AE-safe controllability in the networked
   control system is defined: it describes the ability to prevent the plant
   from reaching unsafe states after attacks are detected. A method for
   testing AE-safe controllability is also presented. Copyright (C) 2020

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication
   capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do
   so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors,
   actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of
   communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to
   cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most
   powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where
   the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the
   attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense
   strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or
   control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event
   systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security
   (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the
   system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose
   online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we
   propose an algorithm to verify this property.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates attack mitigation problem in supervisory control
   of discrete event systems. We consider the scenario where the system is
   subject to actuator enablement attack. We explicitly distinguish between
   controllable events and defendable events; the former are events that
   can be disabled by the normal supervisor but may be subject to attack,
   while the latter are events that can be defensed (disabled definitely)
   by the mitigation module but possibly with higher costs. The objective
   is to design an attack mitigation strategy to prevent serious damage
   from attack. We formulate the attack mitigation problem as a tolerant
   control problem under partial observation. Particularly, in addition to
   guarantee safety, we aim to maximize the desirable behavior (normal
   specification) while minimize the tolerable behavior (safe but not
   desirable). We provide an effective online algorithm for solving this
   problem, which yields a novel attack mitigation strategy that
   generalizes the existing one in the literature. Specifically, we show
   that the proposed strategy may still prevent damage even when the
   safe-controllability condition, which is required by the existing
   strategy, does not hold.},

   systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the

   partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the
   ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the
   supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state.
   We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate
   the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic
   automata. Specifically, we quantify each attack strategy based on the
   likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. The solution
   methodology that we develop uses techniques from the area of stochastic
   graph-games, specifically turn-based one-player stochastic reachability

Title = {Observation-assisted heuristic synthesis of covert attackers against
   unknown supervisors},
Journal = {DISCRETE EVENT DYNAMIC SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of synthesis of covert attackers in
   the setup where the model of the plant is available, but the model of
   the supervisor is unknown, to the adversary. To compensate the lack of
   knowledge on the supervisor, we assume that the adversary has recorded a
   (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the
   closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We
   present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert
   damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the
   (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an
   instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem. The
   heuristic algorithm developed in this paper may allow the adversary to
   synthesize covert attackers without having to know the model of the
   supervisor, which could be hard to obtain in practice. For simplicity,
   we shall only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out
   sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks. The
   effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a water tank example
   adapted from the literature.},

Abstract = {With the growing use and popularity of Internet among people, security
   threats such as viruses, worms etc., are also rapidly increasing. In
   order to detect and prevent such threats, many antivirus softwares have
   been created. Signature matching approach used to detect malwares can be
   easily thwarted by using code obfuscation techniques. In this paper, we

Abstract = {We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the context of
   the supervisory control layer. Specifically, we propose a general model
   of a CPS attacker in the framework of Discrete Event Systems (DES) and
   investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given
   controlled system. Our model captures a class of deception attacks,
   where the attacker has the ability to modify a subset of sensor readings
   and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an
   undesirable state. We introduce a new type of a bipartite transition
   structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA), to capture
   the game-like interaction between the supervisor and the environment
   (which includes the system and attacker). This structure is a discrete
   transition system that embeds information about all possible attacker's
   stealthy actions, and all states (some possibly unsafe) that become
   reachable as a result of those actions. We present a procedure for the
   construction of the IDA and discuss its properties. Based on the IDA, we
   discuss the characterization of successful stealthy attacks, i.e.,
   attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the
   system.},

   compromised by a malicious attacker intent on causing damage to the
   system. We study this problem at the supervisory layer of the control
   system, using discrete event systems techniques. We assume that the
   attacker can edit the outputs from the sensors of the system before they
   reach the supervisory controller. In this context, we formulate the
   problem of synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large
   class of edit attacks on the sensor readings. We solve this problem
   using a new methodology that improves upon prior work on this topic. The
   solution methodology is based on the solution of a partially observed
   supervisory control problem with arbitrary control patterns. We also
   provide results on the existence of a supremal robust supervisor.},

Abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents a backbone of modern
   reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), which enable manufacturing
   of a high product variety through rapid and easy reconfiguration of
   manufacturing equipment. In IIoT-enabled RMS, modular equipment is built
   from smart devices, each performing its own tasks, whereas the global
   functioning is achieved through their networking and intensive
   communication. Although device communication contributes to the system
   reconfigurability, it also opens up new security challenges due to
   potential vulnerability of communication links. In this article, we
   present security analysis for a major part of RMS in which manufacturing
   equipment is sequentially controlled and can be modeled as discrete
   event systems (DES). Control distribution within DES implies
   communication of certain events between smart modules. Specifically, in
   this work, we focus on attacks on communication of these events. In
   particular, we develop a method for modeling such attacks, including
   event insertion and removal attacks, in distributed sequential control;
   the method is based on the supervisory control theory framework. We show
   how the modeled attacks can be detected and provide a method for
   identification of communication links that require protection to avoid
   catastrophic damage of the system. Finally, we illustrate and
   experimentally validate applicability of our methodology on a real-world
   industrial case study with reconfigurable manufacturing equipment.},

Abstract = {In this work, we study supervisory control of discrete event systems in
   the presence of network-based attacks on information delivered to and
   from the supervisors. The attacks are modeled by finite state
   transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a
   word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called
   controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures
   that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible
   attack behavior is the desired one we refer to such supervisors as
   attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal
   controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the
   design algorithm for an attack resilient supervisor, in scenarios where
   no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and
   the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has
   active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which
   ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it.
   Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of
   distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a
   desired language is controllable with intermittently secure
   communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure
   channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate
   our approach on several examples.},

Abstract = {While cryptography is used to protect the content of information (e.g.,
   a message) by making it undecipherable, behaviors (as opposed to
   information) may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially
   or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity (by providing covers that
   generate indistinguishable observations from secrets). Having a cover
   together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the
   system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about
   secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the
   occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper,
   we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify
   secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic
   discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference
   between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret
   and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the
   proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual
   information between the distributions over possible observations and
   that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an
   adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer
   period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as
   obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation
   for the proposed measure is also presented. Illustrative examples,
   including the one with side-channel attack, are provided to demonstrate
   the proposed computation approach.
   Note to Practitioners-Secrecy is the ability to hide private
   information. For communicated information, this can be done through
   encryption or access control. However, the same is not possible for
   system behaviors, and in contrast, cover is introduced for providing
   ambiguity. Quantifying the ability to hide secrets is a challenge. This
   paper provides a means to quantify this in terms of a type of distance
   measure between a secret and its cover. A computation of the same is
   also provided for partially observed stochastic discrete event systems
   and illustrated through a cache's side-channel secrecy loss example.},

Abstract = {Over the last year, the Internet of Things (IoT) drove the development
   of cyber-physical systems, leading the convergence between information
   and operational technologies. This coupling improves performances and
   saves costs but increases the number of vulnerabilities and the attack
   surface to malicious actors. Consequently, it is mandatory to understand
   how IoT devices can be properly integrated into a more secure
   environment. This issue is even more crucial in the field of Critical
   Infrastructures, such as energy, water, transportation, and
   telecommunications. To this aim, this paper analyzes the concept of
   opacity for Discrete Event, Systems (DES) and applies it to a real
   system. The opacity describes the ability of the system to keep some
   states secret even if an attacker knows the happening of some events.
   The proposed approach is validated by applying the concept of opacity on
   the analysis over a simple system. It is demonstrated that opacity can
   be guaranteed and exploited when systems having different levels of
   security are integrated.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {147185-147198},
Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have been highly integrated into many
   contemporary infrastructures. As this integration deepens, the
   importance of protecting these systems from unauthorized access and data
   corruption increases. Nowadays, cyber-physical systems are not well
   protected against network attacks. One solution is to improve the
   security of a system by encrypting the transmitted data. In this paper,
   we consider the encryption of supervisors of discrete event systems
   modeled with deterministic finite-state automata. We propose an
   encryption framework of supervisory control systems based on the matrix
   notation of automata. The purpose of using matrix notation is to make it
   suitable for homomorphic encryption schemes over integers, which are
   emerging in the cryptography area. We calculate the entropy of the
   matrix notation and find that as the size of a system increases, it gets
   smaller and approaches zero. Owing to the low entropy of the matrix
   notation, we propose an algorithm to enhance its entropy. By applying
   the entropy-enhancing process, the distribution characteristics of
   entries in matrices or vectors can be hidden to avoid a brute force
   attack. Correspondingly, we propose an entropy restoration algorithm to
   ensure that the control action can be transmitted correctly.},

Abstract = {One of alternative ways to achieve a competitive advantage by an
   enterprise in the ICT area is to select the most prospective information
   system (IS) as a seed technology. The latter is defined as a first
   technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that
   determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies
   from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for
   enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service
   provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction
   scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs,
   taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the
   functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other
   factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event
   systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is
   supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS
   innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise
   IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We
   present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge
   base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use
   of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three
   popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the
   first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed
   technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended
   variant of the above application may also provide decision support to
   developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply
   the best-possible technology development and market strategies.},

Abstract = {6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6
   connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices
   using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of
   Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial
   Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive
   implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms
   render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of
   duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets
   the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the buffer,
   which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing
   research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic
   solutions and split buffer approaches to intelligently guarantee buffer
   reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme
   using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State
   Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work
   has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before.
   We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the
   malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state
   estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on
   Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme
   provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared
   to the state of the art solutions.},

Abstract = {The rapidly growing use of modern computer-integrated systems involving
   critical assets underscores the need for developing measures to
   guarantee their security against malicious attacks. This paper deals
   with the problem of language-based opacity formulation and verification
   in the framework of discrete event systems modeled with partially
   observed Petri nets (POPNs). In this context, a secret behavior is
   defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who
   partially observes the system's evolution. A Petri net system is
   qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event
   sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this
   paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the
   language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed
   algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that
   is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first
   search on a portion of the system's execution. Complexity analysis and
   experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the
   proposed approach. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

Abstract = {Opacity is an important security notion for discrete event systems
   (DESs) to measure the secret behaviors leaked to an intruder. The
   intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts
   to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the
   system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures
   for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is
   assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that
   modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich
   memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs,
   called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder
   is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors
   that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the
   calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure
   can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs
   attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we
   present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the
   privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services.},

Volume = {88},
Number = {2},
Pages = {217-236},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {We focus on the control and the synthesis of secure timed systems which
   are modelled as timed automata. The security property that the system
   must satisfy is a non-interference property. Intuitively,
   non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from a
   high-level domain to a lower level domain. Various notions of
   non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper,
   we focus on strong non-deterministic non-interference (SNNI) and two
   (bi)simulation-based variants thereof (cosimulation-based SNNI and
   bisimulation-based SNNI). These properties and their extensions have
   been mostly studied in the context of discrete event systems, while it
   is now well-known that time is an important attack vector against secure
   systems.
   At the same time, there is an obvious interest in going beyond simple
   verification to control problems: to be able to automatically make
   systems secure.
   We consider non-interference properties in the challenging setting of
   control of dense-time systems specified by timed automata and we study
   the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a
   sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes, (2) compute a
   (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent.
   We exhibit decidable sub-classes for these problems, assess their
   theoretical complexities and provide effective algorithms based on the
   classical framework of timed games.},

Title = {<p>A framework for current-state opacity under dynamic information
   release mechanism</p>},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {140},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {ABSTR A C T Opacity is an important information-flow security property
   that characterizes the plausible deniability of a dynamic system for its
   ``secret `` against eavesdropping attacks. As an information-flow
   property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling
   and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification
   of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type
   observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the
   observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a
   new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information
   release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous ``hold
   on `` events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of
   opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the
   standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for
   observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by
   constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state
   opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational
   complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed
   approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type
   observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense
   that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information
   is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is
   more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations. (C)\& nbsp;2022

Abstract = {Manufacturing systems may be subject to external attacks and failures,
   so it is important to deal with the recovery of the system after these
   situations. This article deals with the problem of recovering a
   manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the
   supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called
   supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The
   desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in
   uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if
   there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of
   each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known
   state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this
   article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and
   specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT.
   The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a
   local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model
   problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata
   such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the
   control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners-Given the
   unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial
   systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the
   plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state,
   recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial
   processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts
   of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs),
   introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling
   phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the
   control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach
   allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery
   procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).},

Title = {A Liveness-Enforcing Supervisor Tolerant to Sensor-Reading Modification
   Attacks},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS},
Abstract = {In cyber-physical systems (CPSs), it is of great importance to handle
   network attack issues. In this article, we consider the supervisory
   control layer of CPSs, focusing on closed-loop control systems
   vulnerable to sensor-reading modification attacks (SM-attacks), which
   may disguise the occurrence of an event as a different event by
   modifying appropriately sensor readings in sensor communication
   channels. In particular, we consider the plant modeled as a bounded
   Petri net and the control specification consisting in liveness
   enforcing. Based on repeatedly computing a more restrictive
   liveness-enforcing supervisor under no attack and constructing a
   so-called basic supervisor, a method that synthesizes a
   liveness-enforcing supervisor tolerant to an SM-attack is proposed.},
