abstract={In this paper we study a resilient supervisory control design problem in discrete-event systems. Consider that there are certain unsafe states in the system that must be prevented from entering, and this can be ensured by a supervisor disabling certain controllable events. Also consider that the system is subject to actuator attacks from intruders: some controllable events disabled by a supervisor may be re-enabled by an intruder. Our purpose is to address a challenging scenario where the controllable events that are vulnerable to attacks are indefinite, i.e., any controllable event can be attacked. Associating to each unsafe state with a required safety level (a positive integer), our aim of this work is to design a resilient supervisor such that for every unsafe state q, if the number of actuator attacks is no greater than the safety level of q, then the controlled system is guaranteed to avoid entering q. We first encode the behavior of the system under attack into an automaton called the resiliency automaton. We then show that the resilient supervisor synthesis problem may be cast into a supervisory control problem in the resiliency automaton. Hence, a maximally permissive resilient supervisor can be obtained by using the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on supervisory control design against indefinite actuator attacks in discrete-event systems.},

abstract={The problem of state estimation in the setting of partially-observed discrete event systems subject to cyber attacks is considered. An operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator. An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most $n$ events between two consecutive observations.},

abstract={The problem of stealthy attacks for partially-observed discrete event systems is considered. An operator observes the plant through an observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted by an intruder who can insert and erase some sensor readings. We construct an attack structure A which guarantees that, when the plant reaches an unsafe state, A can make the operator think that the plant is in a safe state. Based on A, we can obtain a stealthy attack structure As by simply removing from A all the exposing states, all the weakly exposing states and their input and output arcs. The stealthy attack structure As only contains the possible attacks that can not be detected by the operator.},

abstract={Unlike information, behaviors cannot be encrypted and may instead be protected by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from behaviors needed to be kept secret. Such a scheme may still leak information about secrets due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is a possible means of quantifying statistical difference between two distributions and was used to measure such information leak as in our earlier work [1]. This paper studies secrecy quantification in stochastic partially-observed discrete event systems in the presence of distributed collusive attackers/observers, each with its own local partial observability, generalizing the setting of single observer in [1]. The local observers collude and exchange their observations over communication channels that introduce bounded delays. We propose a method to compute the JSD-based secrecy measure in this distributed setting by introducing bounded-delay channel models to extend the system model to capture the effect of exchange of observations, and to measure the distributed secrecy loss.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate joint sensor-actuator cyber attacks in discrete event systems. We assume that attackers can attack some sensors and actuators at the same time by altering observations and control commands. Because of the nondeterminism in observation and control caused by cyber attacks, the behavior of the supervised systems becomes nondeterministic and deviates from the target. We define two bounds on languages, an upper-bound and a lower-bound, to describe the nondeterministic behavior. We then use the upper-bound language to investigate the safety supervisory control problem under cyber attacks. After introducing CA-controllability and CA-observability, we successfully solve the supervisory control problem under cyber attacks.},

abstract={While cryptography is used to protect the content of information (e.g., a message) by making it undecipherable, behaviors (as opposed to information) may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity (by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from secrets). Having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper, we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation for the proposed measure is also presented. Illustrative examples, including the one with side-channel attack, are provided to demonstrate the proposed computation approach.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a key technology in the development of distributed and autonomous large scale systems. However, one of their undesirable side effects is the fact that they are particularly exposed to cyber attacks carried out by malicious intruders. Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the plant under attack.},

We study the supervisory control problem in cases when attacks occur: (i) only on the sensors, (ii) only on the actuators, and (iii) both on the actuators and sensors of the plant. For each case, we present new sets of controllability theorems and synthesizing algorithms for attack-resilient supervisors.

abstract={Opacity is an important security notion for discrete event systems (DESs) to measure the secret behaviors leaked to an intruder. The intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs, called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of physical processes that are controlled or monitored by software and communication capabilities. Sensors and actuators are elements of CPS that can be vulnerable to attacks. Sensor attacks typically consist in corrupting or hiding information received from sensors, or creating nonexisting information. Actuator attacks typically consist in intercepting and modifying orders sent to actuators. Attacks may lead to serious situations that we will call failures. We adopt a discrete event system (DES) approach, where information received from sensors and actions realized by actuators are represented as discrete events. We first develop a model of the attacked system using supervisory control of DES. Then, we study the defense viewpoint, where we develop methods to detect attacks and avoid failures, and determine conditions of attack detectability and failure avoidability. Then, we study the attacker's viewpoint, where we develop a strategy based on supervisory control of DES to make the attacker undetectable.},

abstract={6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6 connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the butter, which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic solutions and split butter approaches to intelligently guarantee butter reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before. We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared to the state of the art solutions.},

There has been a large number of different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and computer science communities. In this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system in order to trick a given supervisor to issue control commands improperly, driving the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker point of view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata.},

abstract={This paper deals with decentralized fault diagnosis for a discrete-event system that is observed at multiple observation sites through communication channels that can be attacked. The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker, assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and results in a "local" symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e., only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a certain total cost.},

abstract={The development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has brought much attention of researchers to cyber-attack and cyber-security. A sensor attacker targeting on supervised discrete event system can modify a set of sensor readings and cause the closed-loop system to reach undesirable states. In this paper, we propose a new attack detection mechanism under which the supervisor only needs to keep track of the last observable event received. Given a plant and a supervisor enforcing a state specification, we define a sensor attacker threatening if it may cause the closed-loop system to enter a forbidden state. Our goal is to verify whether there exists such a threatening sensor attacker for a given controlled system. A new structure, called All Sensor Attack (ASA), is proposed to capture all possible sensor attacks launched by the attacker. Based on the ASA automaton, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a stealthy threatening sensor attacker is presented. Finally, we show that the condition can be verified in polynomial time.},

abstract={Wi-Fi technology has seen rapid growth in the last two decades. It has revolutionized the way we access the Internet. However, they are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack, the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin attacks in a Wi-Fi network.},

Our model captures a class of deception attacks, where the attacker has the ability to modify a subset of sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an undesirable state. We introduce a new type of a bipartite transition structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA), to capture the game-like interaction between the supervisor and the environment (which includes the system and attacker). This structure is a discrete transition system that embeds information about all possible attacker's stealthy actions, and all states (some possibly unsafe) that become reachable as a result of those actions. We present a procedure for the construction of the IDA and discuss its properties. Based on the IDA, we discuss the characterization of successful stealthy attacks, i.e., attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the system.},

abstract={In this work, we study supervisory control of discrete event systems in the presence of network-based attacks on information delivered to and from the supervisors. The attacks are modeled by finite state transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible attack behavior is the desired one - we refer to such supervisors as attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the design algorithm for an attack-resilient supervisor, in scenarios where no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it. Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a desired language is controllable with intermittently secure communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach on several examples.},

abstract={This paper investigates attack mitigation problem in supervisory control of discrete event systems. We consider the scenario where the system is subject to actuator enablement attack. We explicitly distinguish between controllable events and defendable events; the former are events that can be disabled by the normal supervisor but may be subject to attack, while the latter are events that can be defensed (disabled definitely) by the mitigation module but possibly with higher costs. The objective is to design an attack mitigation strategy to prevent serious damage from attack. We formulate the attack mitigation problem as a tolerant control problem under partial observation. Particularly, in addition to guarantee safety, we aim to maximize the desirable behavior (normal specification) while minimize the tolerable behavior (safe but not desirable). We provide an effective online algorithm for solving this problem, which yields a novel attack mitigation strategy that generalizes the existing one in the literature. Specifically, we show that the proposed strategy may still prevent damage even when the safe-controllability condition, which is required by the existing strategy, does not hold.},

abstract={The use of networked controllers is rising and with it the requirements for safe and secure communication. In this paper, a controller encryption scheme for discrete event systems is presented that secures the communication and the information inside the controller. By adapting a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme to encrypt the controller parameters and variables, it is much more difficult for attackers to gather information about the controller and plant. The homomorphic encryption scheme allows the evaluation of encrypted data without additional decryption and encryption steps. Thus the controller can be evaluated completely in the encrypted domain. We show how to change a controller based on a signal interpreted Petri net (SIPN) into an encrypted SIPN controller and illustrate the approach by a simulation example.},

abstract={Manufacturing systems may be subject to external attacks and failures, so it is important to deal with the recovery of the system after these situations. This article deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners—Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state, recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs), introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).},

abstract={This article addresses the robust control problem of discrete event systems assuming that replacement attacks may occur, thus making it appear that an event that has occurred looks like another event. In particular, we assume that this is done by tampering with the sensor-readings in the sensor communication channel. Specifically, we use Petri nets as the reference formalism to model the plant and assume a control specification in terms of a generalized mutual exclusion constraint. We propose three different methods to derive a control policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems. On the contrary, the third method computes a policy more efficiently and reveals more easily implementable in practice. However, this is done at the expense of optimality.},

This is due to the communication networks between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors, which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or devices that are not sufficiently protected.

abstract={Cyber-physical systems have been highly integrated into many contemporary infrastructures. As this integration deepens, the importance of protecting these systems from unauthorized access and data corruption increases. Nowadays, cyber-physical systems are not well protected against network attacks. One solution is to improve the security of a system by encrypting the transmitted data. In this paper, we consider the encryption of supervisors of discrete event systems modeled with deterministic finite-state automata. We propose an encryption framework of supervisory control systems based on the matrix notation of automata. The purpose of using matrix notation is to make it suitable for homomorphic encryption schemes over integers, which are emerging in the cryptography area. We calculate the entropy of the matrix notation and find that as the size of a system increases, it gets smaller and approaches zero. Owing to the low entropy of the matrix notation, we propose an algorithm to enhance its entropy. By applying the entropy-enhancing process, the distribution characteristics of entries in matrices or vectors can be hidden to avoid a brute force attack. Correspondingly, we propose an entropy restoration algorithm to ensure that the control action can be transmitted correctly.},

abstract={Recently, the problem of model-based synthesis of covert attackers has received a lot of attention in the discrete event systems literature. However, all the existing works assume the model of the supervisor to be available (to the adversary) for the synthesis to be effective, which can be unrealistic in practice. In this work, we consider a much more challenging, but more practical, setup where the model of the supervisor is in general not available. To compensate this lack of knowledge, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem over certain surrogate plant. Due to the over-approximation involved in the surrogate plant, the heuristic is provably sound, but in general it is not complete. For simplicity, in this paper we only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks.},

abstract={Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) facilitates reliable operation of systems. Various approaches have been proposed for FDD like Analytical redundancy (AR), Principal component analysis (PCA), Discrete event system (DES) model etc., in the literature. Performance of FDD schemes greatly depends on accuracy of the sensors which measure the system parameters. Due to various reasons like faults, communication errors etc., sensors may occasionally miss or report erroneous values of some system parameters to FDD engine, resulting in measurement inconsistency of these parameters. Schemes like AR, PCA etc., have mechanisms to handle measurement inconsistency, however, they are computationally heavy. DES based FDD techniques are widely used because of computational simplicity, but they cannot handle measurement inconsistency efficiently. Existing DES based schemes do not use Measurement inconsistent (MI) parameters for FDD. These parameters are not permanently unmeasurable or erroneous, so ignoring them may lead to weak diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a Measurement inconsistent discrete event system (MIDES) framework, which uses MI parameters for FDD at the instances they are measured by the sensors. Otherwise, when they are unmeasurable or erroneously reported, the MIDES invokes an estimator diagnoser that predicts the state(s) the system is expected to be in, using the subsequent parameters measured by the other sensors. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated using a pumpvalve system. In addition, an MIDES based intrusion detection system has been developed for detection of rogue dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server attack by mapping the attack to a fault in the DES framework.},

pages={792-808},
abstract={Wi-Fi devices have limited battery life because of which conserving battery life is imperative. The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame(s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA(s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame(s) to retrieve the buffered frame(s) of the sleeping STA(s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA(s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios.},

abstract={Rogue Twin Access Point (AP) is a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot/AP setup by an adversary solely with the purpose of luring Wi-Fi stations (STAs) into connecting to them. An adversary clones the Service Set IDentifier (SSID) [Hotspot Name] as well as the MAC address of the legitimate AP while setting up the rogue twin. When a STA checks for the list of available APs (under presence of rogue twin), it sees only one AP (despite there being two APs with the identical SSID and MAC address). In case the signal strength of the rogue twin is more than the legitimate AP, the STA connects to the rogue twin.In the present study, a Discrete Event System (DES) paradigm based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting rogue twin which is proposed. It overcomes many drawbacks of existing approaches in tackling rogue twin. A normal DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under normal network conditions along with a failure (attacker) DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under rogue twin network conditions is constructed. Using the knowledge of the normal and attacker DES models, a DES diagnoser is constructed to ascertain whether the frame exchange corresponds to a normal or attack condition. Even if an attacker uses multiple techniques to launch the rogue twin the proposed DES based IDS is capable of identifying all such possible instances. We validate the scheme on a real test bed.},

This stringent requirement of DES diagnosability condition renders many systems non-diagnosable. I-diagnosability framework provides a weaker notion of diagnosability than DES diagnosability by considering only those failures that are followed by certain observable event(s) known as indicator events. However, some systems are I-non-diagnosable even in the presence of an indicator event following the failure event. In this paper, we propose I2-diagnosability framework overcomes the shortcomings of the I-diagnosability framework. In I2-DES framework an empowering event ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully.

abstract={Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.},

abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents a backbone of modern reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), which enable manufacturing of a high product variety through rapid and easy reconfiguration of manufacturing equipment. In IIoT-enabled RMS, modular equipment is built from smart devices, each performing its own tasks, whereas the global functioning is achieved through their networking and intensive communication. Although device communication contributes to the system reconfigurability, it also opens up new security challenges due to potential vulnerability of communication links. In this article, we present security analysis for a major part of RMS in which manufacturing equipment is sequentially controlled and can be modeled as discrete event systems (DES). Control distribution within DES implies communication of certain events between smart modules. Specifically, in this work, we focus on attacks on communication of these events. In particular, we develop a method for modeling such attacks, including event insertion and removal attacks, in distributed sequential control; the method is based on the supervisory control theory framework. We show how the modeled attacks can be detected and provide a method for identification of communication links that require protection to avoid catastrophic damage of the system. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally validate applicability of our methodology on a real-world industrial case study with reconfigurable manufacturing equipment.},

abstract={To allow safe operation of an industrial control system under cyberattacks, we have developed a resilient third-party monitoring system that focuses on the attack resistance of its own detection function and the continuous operation of field devices. This system is composed of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for normal control and for fallback control. The normal PLC controls the field devices, and the fallback PLC takes over control after the normal PLC is attacked. This paper aims to model the system in terms of timed discrete event system and supervisory control theorem and realize the systematical fallback control design.},

abstract={The security of computer systems has become essential especially in front of the critical issues of cyber-attacks that can result in the compromise of these systems because any act on a system intends to harm one of the security properties (Confidentiality, Integrity and availability). Studying computer attacks is also essential to design models of attacks aiming to protect against these attacks by modeling the last ones. The development of taxonomies leads to characterize and classify the attacks which lead to understand them. In computer's security taxonomy, we can have two broad categories: cyber-attack's taxonomy and cyber-security taxonomy. In this paper, we propose taxonomy for cyber-attacks according to an attacker vision and the aspect of achieving an attack. This taxonomy is based on 4 dimensions: Attack vector, Result, Type and Target. To generalize our approach, we have used the framework of the Discrete EVent system Specification DEVS. This framework depicts the overall vision of cyber-attacks. To partially validate our work, a simulation is done on a case study of buffer overflow. A DEVS model is described and a simulation is done via this formalism. This case study aims to reinforce our proposal.},

abstract={One of alternative ways to achieve a competitive advantage by an enterprise in the ICT area is to select the most prospective information system (IS) as a seed technology. The latter is defined as a first technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs, taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended variant of the above application may also provide decision support to developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply the best-possible technology development and market strategies.},

abstract={Over the last year, the Internet of Things (IoT) drove the development of cyber-physical systems, leading the convergence between information and operational technologies. This coupling improves performances and saves costs but increases the number of vulnerabilities and the attack surface to malicious actors. Consequently, it is mandatory to understand how IoT devices can be properly integrated into a more secure environment. This issue is even more crucial in the field of Critical Infrastructures, such as energy, water, transportation, and telecommunications. To this aim, this paper analyzes the concept of opacity for Discrete Event Systems (DES) and applies it to a real system. The opacity describes the ability of the system to keep some states secret even if an attacker knows the happening of some events. The proposed approach is validated by applying the concept of opacity on the analysis over a simple system. It is demonstrated that opacity can be guaranteed and exploited when systems having different levels of security are integrated.},

abstract={It is essential to ensure accurate sensor measurements to safely regulate physical process in power control system. Traditional false data injection (FDI) attacks against control system mainly require the attackers to obtain the optimal malicious inputs. Different from the traditional FDI attacks, we present false sequence attack that can disable the fault detection against Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) with partial information about the victim system. Our attack formulation is to identify a discrete event model of collected fault-free I/O traces from compromised PLCs, and find the undetectable false sequences that are selected as desired attacks injected into compromised sensors from the identified model. A representation industrial simulation shows that we construct the false sequence attack against the control system with fault detection.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose and address the problem of supervisor obfuscation against actuator enablement attack, in a common setting where the actuator attacker can eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We propose a method to obfuscate an (insecure) supervisor to make it resilient against actuator enablement attack in such a way that the behavior of the original closed-loop system is preserved. An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability and observability constraints, which can be tackled by using SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors.},

pages={941-946},
abstract={Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an IETF-standardized web transfer protocol, is specially designed to facilitate resource-constrained devices and low power, lossy networks. The steep rise in extensive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, of late, makes it necessary for web services to be used over the internet by constrained wireless nodes for a majority of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications. However, considering that the system is constrained, ensuring security is a challenge when employing CoAP since it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is unrealiable and lacks handshaking mechanism. A malicious endpoint with read and write access can severly jeopardize service availability by launching an IP address spoofed attack. Moreover, it can help mount other complex Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks like amplification attacks. Though response spoofing vulnerability has been addressed in the research community for quite some time now, request spoofing countermeasures are relatively few. In this paper, we propose an attacker identification scheme using a Discrete Event System (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Through our scheme, we not only detect request and response spoofing attack in CoAP, but also identify the adversarial node by analysing the LoWPAN event dynamics generated due to probe responses. Correctness of our approach is guaranteed by construction of a DES diagnoser. We have tested our approach on Contiki OS. The experimental results show our proposed scheme to be energy efficient with response time of approx 6 sec at 99.2% accuracy.},

abstract={In cyber–physical systems (CPSs), it is of great importance to handle network attack issues.

In particular, we consider the plant modeled as a bounded Petri net and the control specification consisting in liveness enforcing. Based on repeatedly computing a more restrictive liveness-enforcing supervisor under no attack and constructing a so-called basic supervisor, a method that synthesizes a liveness-enforcing supervisor tolerant to an SM-attack is proposed.},

Thirdly, sufficient conditions for asymptotic stability of the T-S fuzzy sys¬tem are derived, and the design method of a fuzzy output-based security controller is presented.

abstract={Given a probabilistic transition system (PTS) A partially observed by an attacker, and an ω-regular predicate φ over the traces of A, measuring the disclosure of the secret φ in A means computing the probability that an attacker who observes a run of A can ascertain that its trace belongs to φ. We consider specifications given as Interval Markov Chains (IMCs), which are underspecified Markov chains where probabilities on edges are only required to belong to intervals. Scheduling an IMC S produces a concrete implementation as a PTS and we define the worst case disclosure of secret φ in S as the maximal disclosure of φ over all PTSs thus produced. We compute this value for a subclass of IMCs and we prove that simulation between specifications can only improve the opacity of implementations.},

pages={306-312},
abstract={In computer security, opacity is widely used and considered as a general language-theoretic scheme of many security properties of systems. A secret behaviour of a system is opaque if a passive attacker can never deduce its occurrence from the system observation. In [9], instead of considering the case of static observability where the set of observable events is fixed off-line or dynamic observability where the set of observable events changes over time depending on the history of the trace, we have introduced Orwellian partial observability where unobservable events are not revealed provided that downgrading events never occurs in the future of the trace. We show in the previous paper verifying opacity for regular secret is opaque for a regular language L w.r.t. an Orwellian projection is PSPACE-complete while it has been proved undecidable even for a regular language L w.r.t. a general Orwellian observation function. In this paper, we address two problems of opacification of a regular secret φ for a regular language L w.r.t. an Orwellian projection πo,d: Given L and a secret φ ∈ L, the first problem consists in computing some minimal regular super-language M of L, if it exists, such that φ is opaque for M w.r.t. πo,d and the second consists to compute the supremal sub-language M' of L such that φ is opaque for M' w.r.t. πo,d. We derive both language-theoretic characterizations and algorithms to solve the two problems.},

abstract={The less conservative co-design problem of dual security control and communication for CPS was studied for a class of nonlinear CPS with an actuator fault and DoS attack based on the DETCS. First, combining with the edge computing thought, data filtering and partial computing tasks were assigned to the network edge devices. The DoS attack with limited energy is converted into a special time delay; thus, the discrete event trigger condition, the actuator fault estimation and regulation, and the robustness for DoS attack can be considered uniformly. A dual security control framework of non-uniformly sampled data system was proposed under the DETCS for CPS, and the T-S fuzzy model of closed-loop nonlinear CPS with the co-existence of fault and attack was established. Second, with the help of time-delay system theory, a robust observer for state and fault estimation and the co-design method of dual security control and communication with the actuator fault and DoS attack were obtained by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and using affine Bessel-Legendre inequality. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the theoretical results were verified by a classical quadruple-tank system.},

abstract={Recently, online shopping integrating third-party payment platforms (TPPs) introduces new security challenges due to complex interactions between Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of Merchants and TPPs. Malicious clients may exploit security vulnerabilities by calling APIs in an arbitrary order or playing various roles. To deal with the security issue in the early stages of system development, this paper presents a formal method for modeling and verification of online shopping business processes with malicious behavior patterns considered based on Petri nets. We propose a formal model called E-commerce Business Process Net to model a normal online shopping business process that represent intended functions, and malicious behavior patterns representing a potential attack that violates the security goals at the requirement analysis phase. Then, we synthesize the normal business process and malicious behavior patterns by an incremental modeling method. According to the synthetic model, we analyze whether an online shopping business process is resistant to the known malicious behavior patterns. As a result, our approach can make the software design provably secured from the malicious attacks at process design time and, thus, reduces the difficulty and cost of modification for imperfect systems at the release phase. We demonstrate our approach through a case study.},

abstract={Large and complex systems, such as the Smart Grid, are often best understood through the use of modeling and simulation. In particular, the task of assessing a complex system's risks and testing its tolerance and recovery under various attacks has received considerable attention. However, such tedious tasks still demand a systematic approach to model and evaluate each component in complex systems. In other words, supporting a formal validation and verification without needing to implement the entire system or accessing the existing physical infrastructure is critical since many elements of the Smart Grid are still in the process of becoming standardized for widespread use. In this paper, we describe our simulation-based approach to understanding and examining the behavior of various components of the Smart Grid in the context of verification and validation. To achieve this goal, we adopt the discrete event system specification (DEVS) modeling methodology, which allows generalization and specialization of the entities in the model for a customized simulation with specific scenarios. In addition, we articulate metrics for supporting our simulation-based verification and validation and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we propose an algorithm to verify this property.},
