abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This paper investigates the problem of co-synthesis of edit function and supervisor for opacity enforcement in the supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES), assuming the presence of an external (passive) intruder, where the following goals need to be achieved: 1) the external intruder should never infer the system secret, i.e., the system is opaque, and never be sure about the existence of the edit function, i.e., the edit function remains covert; 2) the controlled plant behaviors should satisfy some safety and nonblockingness requirements, in the presence of the edit function. We focus on the class of edit functions that satisfy the following properties: 1) the observation capability of the edit function in general can be different from those of the supervisor and the intruder; 2) the edit function can implement insertion, deletion, and replacement operations; 3) the edit function performs bounded edit operations, i.e., the length of each string output of the edit function is upper bounded by a given constant. We propose an approach to solve this co-synthesis problem by modeling it as a distributed supervisor synthesis problem in the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control framework. By taking the special structure of this distributed supervisor synthesis problem into consideration and to improve the possibility of finding a non-empty distributed supervisor, we propose two novel synthesis heuristics that incrementally synthesize the supervisor and the edit function. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on an example in the enforcement of the location privacy.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2021, The Authors. All rights reserved.},

Attackers that are able to insert or erase occurrences of particular output symbols can tamper with the supervisor&rsquo;s observation and by doing so, can lead the controlled system to undesirable states. We consider a scenario with multiple attackers, each one being an element of a set, called the attack set. We also assume that only one of the attackers within an attack set is acting, although we don&rsquo;t know which one. According to previous results in the literature, a supervisor that enforces a given legal language, regardless of which attacker is acting, can be designed if the legal language is controllable and satisfies a property called P-observability for an attack set. The latter is an extended notion of observability and is related with the supervisor&rsquo;s ability to always distinguish between outputs that require different control actions, even if the outputs were attacked. We present a new approach for checking if a given language is P-observable for an attack set, by first introducing a visual representation as well as some definitions that capture the attack&rsquo;s effect. Additionally, we present two algorithms that together allow us to verify if a given language is P-observable for an attack set, when it is represented as an automaton.<br/></div> &copy; 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We define two bounds on languages, an upper-bound and a lower-bound, to describe the nondeterministic behavior.

This research touches upon the supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption. Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated through examples.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker, assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and results in a "local"symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e., only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a certain total cost.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 EUCA.},

In this article, the decentralized fault prognosis of partially observed DESs is analyzed with a universal state-estimate-based protocol. It follows (M,K) as the performance bound of any expected decentralized prognosers, where any fault can be predicted K steps before its occurrence and the fault is guaranteed to occur within M steps once a corresponding fault alarm is issued. To determine whether expected decentralized prognosers exist, the notion of state-estimate-coprognosability (SE-coprognosability) under the case of one fault type is proposed. Compared with existing other kinds of coprognosability, SE-coprognosability is a more generalized concept. Meanwhile, combining the formal method and algebraic state space approach, a novel state estimation algorithm is presented and based on which, the verification of SE-coprognosability is also solved.<br/></div> IEEE},

We address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete event systems (NDES). To this end, we propose an automaton model for NDES subject to DoS-D attacks that represents the adverse effects of DoS-D attacks on the observations of local diagnosers. We introduce a new codiagnosability definition called DoS-D-robust codiagnosability, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be DoS-D-robustly codiagnosable.

Consider that there are certain unsafe states in the system that must be prevented from entering, and this can be ensured by a supervisor disabling certain controllable events. Also consider that the system is subject to actuator attacks from intruders: some controllable events disabled by a supervisor may be re-enabled by an intruder. Our purpose is to address a challenging scenario where the controllable events that are vulnerable to attacks are indefinite, i.e., any controllable event can be attacked. Associating to each unsafe state with a required safety level (a positive integer), our aim of this work is to design a resilient supervisor such that for every unsafe state q, if the number of actuator attacks is no greater than the safety level of q, then the controlled system is guaranteed to avoid entering q. We first encode the behavior of the system under attack into an automaton called the resiliency automaton. We then show that the resilient supervisor synthesis problem may be cast into a supervisory control problem in the resiliency automaton. Hence, a maximally permissive resilient supervisor can be obtained by using the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on supervisory control design against indefinite actuator attacks in discrete-event systems.<br/></div> IEEE},

The intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs, called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services.<br/></div> &copy; 1993-2012 IEEE.},

However, one of their undesirable side effects is the fact that they are particularly exposed to cyber attacks carried out by malicious intruders. Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the plant under attack.<br/></div> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">&mdash; Opacity is a security property formalizing the information leakage of a system to an external observer, namely intruder. The conventional opacity that has been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes passive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in many cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are capable of influencing the system&rsquo;s behavior beyond passive observations, need to be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the opacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a non-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has a full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the system by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this setup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion characterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state regardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore extend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity notions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the proposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on RCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be verified by constructing an observer automaton. Illustrative examples are provided throughout the paper to demonstrate the key definition and the effectiveness of the proposed opacity verification approach.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020, The Authors.

In the state-of-the-art, opacity of Discrete Event Systems (DES) has been investigated using a variety of techniques. Methods based on Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) emerge as an efficient approach for enforcing this property. In this paper, we address the problem of enforcing the opacity of a DES through the definition of a supervisor whose role is to restrain the behavior of the system keeping "good" runs only i.e., executions that exactly correspond to the opaque subset of the system&rsquo;s state space. The proposed approach is based on Symbolic Observation Graph: a hybrid graph where nodes are subsets of reachable states linked with unobservable actions. Encoding such nodes symbolically using binary decision diagrams allows to tackle the state space explosion problem. We designed a reduced-cost algorithm that synthesizes an optimal supervisor (at design time) to ensure the opacity of the system (at runtime). Moreover, we implemented our approach in C++ language and we validated our proposition using a real-life case study.<br/></div> &copy; 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">System resilience captures the ability of the system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable performance degradation and to recover within an acceptable time frame. In this monograph we consider two possible sources of major disruptions, i.e., component faults and cyber intrusions. A component fault is an indigenous activity that renders unavailability or inaccessibility of certain functions within a component, either permanently or temporarily. It typically generates safety and performance concerns. Cyber intrusion on the other hand is an exogenous activity that tampers privacy, confidentiality, availability, or integrity of the system. These two sources are not always independent from each other. For example, a cyber intrusion may trigger a component fault, whereas a component fault may open a door for cyber intrusion, e.g., by keeping it undetected. For cyber intrusion, we will focus on opacity, which describes the system's ability to hide certain secrets from an external observer (or eavesdropper), and sensor and actuator attacks that exploit the system's existing controller to generate undesirable behaviours. In this monograph, we provide a detailed account of most recent research outcomes on fault diagnosis, opacity analysis and enhancement, and cyber security analysis and enforcement, within suitable discrete event system modelling frame-works. In each case, we describe basic problem statements and key concepts, and then point out the key challenges in each research area. After that, we present a thorough review of state-of-the-art techniques, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we highlight key research directions for further exploration.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 Now Publishers Inc. All rights reserved.},

We consider a very general system setup as we focus on both deterministic and nondeterministic plants that we model as finite state transducers (FSTs); this also covers the conventional approach to modeling DES as deterministic finite automata. Furthermore, we cover a wide class of attacks that can nondeterministically add, remove, or rewrite a sensing and/or actuation word to any word from predefined regular languages, and show how such attacks can be modeled by nondeterministic FSTs; we also present how the use of FSTs facilitates modeling realistic (and very complex) attacks, as well as provides the foundation for design of attack-resilient supervisory controllers. Specifically, we first consider the supervisory control problem for deterministic plants with attacks (i) only on their sensors, (ii) only on their actuators, and (iii) both on their sensors and actuators. For each case, we develop new conditions for controllability in the presence of attacks, as well as synthesizing algorithms to obtain FST-based description of such attack-resilient supervisors. A derived resilient controller provides a set of all safe control words that can keep the plant work desirably even in the presence of corrupted observation and/or if the control words are subjected to actuation attacks. Then, we extend the controllability theorems and the supervisor synthesizing algorithms to nondeterministic plants that satisfy a nonblocking condition. Finally, we illustrate applicability of our methodology on several examples and numerical case-studies.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2019, The Authors. All rights reserved.},

In more detail, the goal of the supervisor, who has a partial observation of the system evolution, is that of preventing the system from reaching a set of unsafe states. An attacker may act in two different ways: he can corrupt the observation of the supervisor editing the sensor readings, and can enable events that are disabled by the supervisor. This is done with the aim of leading the plant to an unsafe state, and keeping the supervisor unaware of that before the unsafe state is reached. A special automaton, called attack structure is constructed as the parallel composition of two special structures. Such an automaton can be used by the attacker to select appropriate actions (if any) to reach the above goal, or equivalently by the supervisor, to validate its robustness with respect to such attacks.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020, The Authors.

The attacks considered in this paper include arbitrary deletions, insertions, or substitutions of observed symbols by taking into account a bounded number of attacks or, more generally, a total cost constraint (assuming that each deletion, insertion, or substitution bears a positive cost to the attacker). An efficient approach is proposed to describe possible sequences of observations that match the one received by the measuring unit, as well as their corresponding state estimates and associated total costs. We develop an algorithm to obtain the least-cost matching sequences by reconstructing only a finite number of possible sequences, which we subsequently use to efficiently perform state estimation. We also develop a technique for verifying tamper-tolerant diagnosability under attacks that involve a bounded number of deletions, insertions, and substitutions (or, more generally, under attacks of bounded total cost) by using a novel structure obtained by attaching attacks and costs to the original plant. The overall construction and verification procedure have complexity that is of O(|X|<sup>2</sup>C<sup>2</sup>), where |X| is the number of states of the given finite automaton and C is the maximum total cost that is allowed for all the deletions, insertions, and substitutions. We determine the minimum value of C such that the attacker can coordinate its tampering action to keep the observer indefinitely confused while utilizing a finite number of attacks. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed methods.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020, The Authors. All rights reserved.},

This problem is motivated by applications to computer security in which a cyber defense system must make decisions based on reports from sensors that may have been tampered with by an attacker. We start by showing that the problem has a solution if and only if the desired language is controllable (in the Discrete event system classical sense) and observable in a (novel) sense that takes the adversaries into account. For the particular case of attacks that insert symbols into or remove symbols from the sequence of sensor outputs, we show that testing the existence of a supervisor and building the supervisor can be done using tools developed for the classical DES supervisory control problem, by considering a family of automata with modified output maps, but without expanding the size of the state space and without incurring on exponential complexity on the number of attacks considered.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2017, The Authors.

An operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator. An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most n events between two consecutive observations.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2019, The Authors.

In this paper, a controller encryption scheme for discrete event systems is presented that secures the communication and the information inside the controller.

The homomorphic encryption scheme allows the evaluation of encrypted data without additional decryption and encryption steps. Thus the controller can be evaluated completely in the encrypted domain.

However, they are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack, the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of correctness.

Having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper, we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation for the proposed measure is also presented.

We first develop a model of the attacked system using supervisory control of DES.

The local observers collude and exchange their observations over communication channels that introduce bounded delays. We propose a method to compute the JSD-based secrecy measure in this distributed setting by introducing bounded-delay channel models to extend the system model to capture the effect of exchange of observations, and to measure the distributed secrecy loss.<br/> &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Security administrators of companies and organizations need to come up with proper countermeasures against cyber-attacks considering infrastructures and security policies in their possession. In order to develop and verify such countermeasures, the administrators should be able to reenact both cyber-attacks and defenses. Simulations can be useful for the reenactment by overcoming its limitations including high risk and cost. If the administrators are able to design various scenarios of cyber-attacks and to develop simulation models from their viewpoints, they can simulate desired situations and observe the results more easily. It is challenging to simulate cyber-security issues, because there is lack of theoretical basis for modeling a wide range of the security field as well as pre-defined basic components used to model cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a modeling method for cyber-security simulations by developing a basic component and a composite model, called Abstracted Cyber-Security Unit Model (ACSUM) and Abstracted Cyber-security SIMulation model (ACSIM), respectively. The proposed models are based on DEVS(Discrete Event systems Specification) formalism, a modeling theory for discrete event simulations. We develop attack scenarios by sequencing attack behaviors using ACSUMs and then model ACSIMs by combining and abstracting the ACSUMs from a security perspective. The concepts of ACSUM and ACSIM enable the security administrators to simulate numerous cyber-security issues from their viewpoints. As a case study, we model a worm scenario using ACSUM and simulate three types of simulation models based on ACSIM from a different security perspective.<br/> Copyright &copy; 2020 KSII},

"An artificial social system is a set of restrictions on agents` behaviours in a multi-agent environment. Its role is to allow agents to coexist in a shared environment and pursue their respective goals in the presence of other agents" (Moses & Tennenholtz, n.d.). Despite conventional approaches, Cyber Security Model of Artificial Social System Man-Machine is not guided by rigid control algorithms but by flexible, eventadaptable ones that makes them more lively and available. All these allow a new design of artificial social systems dotted with intelligence, autonomous decision-making capabilities, and self-diagnosing properties. Heuristics techniques, data mining planning activities, scheduling algorithms, automatic data identification, processing, and control represent as many trumps for these new systems analyzing formalism.

A notable characteristic of ICS, compared to Information Technology, is the necessity to take into account the physical process, and its specific dynamics and effects on the environment, when considering cybersecurity issues. Intrusion Detection Systems have been studied extensively. In our work, we address the less classic topic of response mechanisms, and their automation in a self-protection feedback loop. More precisely, we address self-protection seen as resilience, where the functionality of the system is maintained under attacks, be it in a degraded mode. We model this as a Discrete Event Systems supervisory control problem, involving a model of the plant's possible behaviors, a model of considered attacks, and a formulation of the control objectives. We consider a case study, and perform a prototype implementation and simulation, using the Heptagon/BZR programming language and compiler/code generator, and targeting a multi-PLC experimental platform.<br/></div> &copy; 2020 The Authors.

The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment.<br/></div> &copy; 2017},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Cybersecurity of discrete event systems (DES) has been gaining more and more attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems. One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks. We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand-supply relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are regular, it is possible to remove all such risky pairs from the plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks. The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far has not been achieved in the literature.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020, The Authors.

This paper proposes the use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack models presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The least-unsafe (LU) supervisor problem is introduced to minimize this unsafe likelihood measure and improve existing attack mitigation techniques.

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">This paper investigates the problem of synthesizing sensor deception attackers against privacy in the context of supervisory control of discrete-event systems (DES). We consider a DES plant controlled by a supervisor, which is subject to sensor deception attacks. Specifically, we consider an active attacker that can tamper with the observations received by the supervisor by, e.g., hacking on the communication channel between the sensors and the supervisor. The privacy requirement of the supervisory control system is to maintain initial-state opacity, i.e., it does not want to reveal the fact that it was initiated from a secret state during its operation. On the other hand, the attacker aims to deceive the supervisor, by tampering with its observations, such that initial-state opacity is violated due to incorrect control actions. In this work, we investigate from the attacker&rsquo;s point of view by presenting an effective approach for synthesizing sensor attack strategies threatening the privacy of the system. To this end, we propose the All Attack Structure (AAS) that records state estimates for both the supervisor and the attacker. This structure serves as a basis for synthesizing a sensor attack strategy. We also discuss how to simplify the synthesis complexity by leveraging the structural property of the initial-state privacy requirement. A running academic example is provided to illustrate the synthesis procedure.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2022, The Authors. All rights reserved.},

The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame (s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA (s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame (s) to retrieve the buffered frame (s) of the sleeping STA (s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA (s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios.<br/></div> &copy; 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

Thus, rapid completion of the operation is essential to preserve combat power and sustain the momentum of attack. However, there are not many endeavors to shorten the time of river crossing by improving tactical and operational methods. Hence, it is required to find improved operation methods of engineer river crossing equipment through validating the effectiveness of current tactic. In this research, we built a model that represent military operation of river crossing based on discrete event systems specification (DEVS) and simulated the operation to experiment operation methods with the model. We limited the river crossing operation to the operation of rafts of Ribbon Bridge System (RBS).

We propose three different methods to derive a control policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems.

In order to do so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we propose an algorithm to verify this property.<br/></div> IEEE},

We model the ABP and TCP protocols and system architecture by finite-state automata and employ the supervisory control theory of discrete event systems to pose and solve the synthesis of For-all attacks, where the attacker has partial observability and controllability of the system events.

However, all the existing works assume the model of the supervisor to be available (to the adversary) for the synthesis to be effective, which can be unrealistic in practice. In this work, we consider a much more challenging, but more practical, setup where the model of the supervisor is in general not available. To compensate this lack of knowledge, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem over certain surrogate plant. Due to the over-approximation involved in the surrogate plant, the heuristic is provably sound, but in general it is not complete. For simplicity, in this paper we only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 IEEE.},

In IIoT-enabled RMS, modular equipment is built from smart devices, each performing its own tasks, whereas the global functioning is achieved through their networking and intensive communication. Although device communication contributes to the system reconfigurability, it also opens up new security challenges due to potential vulnerability of communication links. In this article, we present security analysis for a major part of RMS in which manufacturing equipment is sequentially controlled and can be modeled as discrete event systems (DES). Control distribution within DES implies communication of certain events between smart modules. Specifically, in this work, we focus on attacks on communication of these events. In particular, we develop a method for modeling such attacks, including event insertion and removal attacks, in distributed sequential control; the method is based on the supervisory control theory framework. We show how the modeled attacks can be detected and provide a method for identification of communication links that require protection to avoid catastrophic damage of the system. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally validate applicability of our methodology on a real-world industrial case study with reconfigurable manufacturing equipment.<br/> &copy; 2005-2012 IEEE.},

The objective is to design an attack mitigation strategy to prevent serious damage from attack. We formulate the attack mitigation problem as a tolerant control problem under partial observation. Particularly, in addition to guarantee safety, we aim to maximize the desirable behavior (normal specification) while minimize the tolerable behavior (safe but not desirable). We provide an effective online algorithm for solving this problem, which yields a novel attack mitigation strategy that generalizes the existing one in the literature.

abstract = {One of alternative ways to achieve a competitive advantage by an enterprise in the ICT area is to select the most prospective information system (IS) as a seed technology. The latter is defined as a first technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs, taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended variant of the above application may also provide decision support to developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply the best-possible technology development and market strategies.<br/> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

abstract = {6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6 connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the butter, which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic solutions and split butter approaches to intelligently guarantee butter reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before. We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared to the state of the art solutions.<br/> &copy; 2020 IEEE.},

The attacks are modeled by finite state transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible attack behavior is the desired one - we refer to such supervisors as attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the design algorithm for an attack-resilient supervisor, in scenarios where no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it. Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a desired language is controllable with intermittently secure communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach on several examples.<br/></div> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

Specifically, we propose a general model of a CPS attacker in the framework of Discrete Event Systems (DES) and investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given controlled system. Our model captures a class of deception attacks, where the attacker has the ability to modify a subset of sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an undesirable state. We introduce a new type of a bipartite transition structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA), to capture the game-like interaction between the supervisor and the environment (which includes the system and attacker). This structure is a discrete transition system that embeds information about all possible attacker's stealthy actions, and all states (some possibly unsafe) that become reachable as a result of those actions. We present a procedure for the construction of the IDA and discuss its properties. Based on the IDA, we discuss the characterization of successful stealthy attacks, i.e., attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the system.<br/> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

This paper deals with the problem of language-based opacity formulation and verification in the framework of discrete event systems modeled with partially observed Petri nets (POPNs). In this context, a secret behavior is defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who partially observes the system's evolution. A Petri net system is qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first search on a portion of the system's execution.

Enforcing opacity in a discrete-event system, encoded by a finite labelled transition system (LTS), is a way to avoid information leakage. Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker).

abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have been highly integrated into many contemporary infrastructures. As this integration deepens, the importance of protecting these systems from unauthorized access and data corruption increases. Nowadays, cyber-physical systems are not well protected against network attacks. One solution is to improve the security of a system by encrypting the transmitted data. In this paper, we consider the encryption of supervisors of discrete event systems modeled with deterministic finite-state automata. We propose an encryption framework of supervisory control systems based on the matrix notation of automata. The purpose of using matrix notation is to make it suitable for homomorphic encryption schemes over integers, which are emerging in the cryptography area. We calculate the entropy of the matrix notation and find that as the size of a system increases, it gets smaller and approaches zero. Owing to the low entropy of the matrix notation, we propose an algorithm to enhance its entropy. By applying the entropy-enhancing process, the distribution characteristics of entries in matrices or vectors can be hidden to avoid a brute force attack. Correspondingly, we propose an entropy restoration algorithm to ensure that the control action can be transmitted correctly.<br/> &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous "hold on" events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Opacity was first studied for discrete event systems, and then it was extended to real-time systems. One of the challenges of real-time systems is the difficulty to guarantee their opacity against a potential attacker. In general, this property is undecidable for systems modeled by timed automata. A secret location, S, of a system is timed opaque to an intruder having partial observability of the system, if the intruder can never infer from the observation of any execution that the system has reached any secret location. In the present study, the static partial observability for systems modeled by nondeterministic timed automata is investigated. Thus, it focuses on systems where the timing of secret state reachability is bounded. The first contribution of this study is to define the bounded timed opacity property wherein, its complexity is proved. The second contribution is to consider systems where the secret should be kept hidden for a certain period referred to as the &Delta;-duration bounded opacity property. Also, a formal definition is proposed and its complexity is proved. In addition, the proposed properties are verified using timed bounded model checking. A case study "Exchange in the Cloud system" is modeled by timed automaton to verify the proposed properties using SpaceEx tool.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

This coupling improves performances and saves costs but increases the number of vulnerabilities and the attack surface to malicious actors. Consequently, it is mandatory to understand how IoT devices can be properly integrated into a more secure environment. This issue is even more crucial in the field of Critical Infrastructures, such as energy, water, transportation, and telecommunications. To this aim, this paper analyzes the concept of opacity for Discrete Event Systems (DES) and applies it to a real system. The opacity describes the ability of the system to keep some states secret even if an attacker knows the happening of some events. The proposed approach is validated by applying the concept of opacity on the analysis over a simple system. It is demonstrated that opacity can be guaranteed and exploited when systems having different levels of security are integrated.<br/> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

This article deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners - Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state, recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs), introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).<br/></div> &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.},

Intuitively, non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from a high-level domain to a lower level domain. Various notions of non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper, we focus on strong non-deterministic non-interference (SNNI) and two (bi)simulation-based variants thereof (cosimulation-based SNNI and bisimulation-based SNNI). These properties and their extensions have been mostly studied in the context of discrete event systems, while it is now well-known that time is an important attack vector against secure systems.At the same time, there is an obvious interest in going beyond simple verification to control problems: to be able to automatically make systems secure.We consider non-interference properties in the challenging setting of control of dense-time systems specified by timed automata and we study the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes, (2) compute a (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent.We exhibit decidable sub-classes for these problems, assess their theoretical complexities and provide effective algorithms based on the classical framework of timed games.<br/> &copy; 2014 Taylor & Francis.},
