abstract = {With the rapid growth of cyber-physical systems (CPS), the requirements on the security of such systems increases, since the communication networks between the controllers, actuators and sensors are vulnerable to attacks. In this paper, a detection method for cyber attacks on CPSs modeled by discrete event systems is proposed. Deception attacks hide their influence and are particular challenging to detect. Two such attacks are replay attack and covert attack. The modeling and detection of these two attack types is presented. We introduce permutation matrices which alter the transmitted signals to disrupt the attack and allow the detection. The proposed approach is illustrated by a laboratory manufacturing system.}

In this paper, we consider that the CPS is abstracted as a Discrete-Event System (DES), and we consider cyber attacks where the intruder eavesdrops the sensor communication channel to detect the occurrence of a sequence in the secret behavior of the system. In order to prevent the attacker from getting information from the sensor channel, we introduce a new cryptographic scheme based on events called event-based cryptography. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES, present a necessary and sufficient condition for ensuring this property, and propose a verification test.}

The main motives for the interest to ICS is the ease for performing cyberattacks and the potential damages inflicted to the system and its environment in case of success. The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for detecting malicious orders in discrete-event system. Four types of attacks (direct, sequential, temporal and over-soliciting) that affect an industrial system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the “automation-knowledge”. Thus, by using models of system with an improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent. Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on simulation examples and an industrial platform. To conclude, improvements of our approach are discussed.}

Our strategy involves two agents having reverse priority decision-making policies, while searching the maze with a depth-first search control policy. Under our definition of inefficiency, which is a function of the number of dead end states that are searched by both agents, we show that our method achieves the minimum inefficiency cost, and thus performs as well as any communication-based solution.}

abstract = {Resilience is a critical criterion to evaluate a networked system including discrete-event systems (DESs). This research touches upon the supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption. Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated through examples.}

We present a mathematical model for the system under certain classes of actuator enablement attacks, sensor erasure attacks, or sensor insertion attacks. We then propose a defense strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of unsafe system states. The technical condition of interest that is necessary and sufficient in this context, termed “GF-safe controllability”, is characterized.

The general purpose for multi-agent coordination is to synthesize a plan such that the LTL task is achieved optimally. In addition to the standard requirement on the correctness of the plan, we further investigate the potential information leakage of each agent during the operating process. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the behavior of each individual agent is partially monitored by a passive intruder modeled as an outside observer or an eavesdropper. The security constraint requires that the intruder can never identify for sure that some specific individual agent is carrying out some sub-tasks of significant importance. To this end, we model the mobile capability of the agent team by a global labeled transition system. To describe information-flow security constraint, motivated by the generic notion of opacity, two different types security requirements are proposed for each individual agent. An effective coordination algorithm is proposed that synthesizes an optimal global plan for the entire agent team such that the global LTL task can be achieved, while the security of each individual agent is preserved. The proposed framework is implemented in real-world experiment and is also demonstrated by several case studies.}

The attacker can corrupt the control input generated by the supervisor, and aims at driving the plant to unsafe states. We propose a new approach to model the closed-loop system subject to control delays and attacks. The notion of AE-safe controllability in the networked control system is defined: it describes the ability to prevent the plant from reaching unsafe states after attacks are detected. A method for testing AE-safe controllability is also presented.}

As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous “hold on” events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations.}

abstract = {In many security applications, system behaviors must be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (intruders). Opacity was first studied for discrete event systems, and then it was extended to real-time systems. One of the challenges of real-time systems is the difficulty to guarantee their opacity against a potential attacker. In general, this property is undecidable for systems modeled by timed automata. A secret location, S, of a system is timed opaque to an intruder having partial observability of the system, if the intruder can never infer from the observation of any execution that the system has reached any secret location. In the present study, the static partial observability for systems modeled by nondeterministic timed automata is investigated. Thus, it focuses on systems where the timing of secret state reachability is bounded. The first contribution of this study is to define the bounded timed opacity property wherein, its complexity is proved. The second contribution is to consider systems where the secret should be kept hidden for a certain period referred to as the Δ-duration bounded opacity property. Also, a formal definition is proposed and its complexity is proved. In addition, the proposed properties are verified using timed bounded model checking. A case study ”Exchange in the Cloud system” is modeled by timed automaton to verify the proposed properties using SpaceEx tool.}

abstract = {The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization (OO) is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at “order” in performances among designs instead of “value” and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the OO solution, is a key step in applying the OO method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended.}

We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker’s point of view, and formulate an attack-with-bounded-sensor-reading-alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be computed, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which computes a supervisor that is ABSRA-robust in the sense that any ABSRA will either be detectable or inflict no damage to the system.}

We first introduce usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable events with at least a certain security level, and the highest usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES.

abstract = {This paper focuses on the Fallback Control System (FCS), which is an emergency response method of networked Industrial Control System (ICS) as a countermeasure for cyber-attacks. The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment.}

However, not much consideration was given on studying the possibility of attackers exploiting the protocol, which has lead to several attacks on TCP. This paper deals with the induced low rate TCP attack. Since the attack is relatively new, only a few schemes have been proposed to mitigate it. However, the main issues with these schemes are scalability, change in TCP header, lack of formal frameworks, etc. In this paper, we have adapted the stochastic DES framework for detecting the attack, which addresses most of these issues. We have successfully deployed and tested the proposed DES based IDS on a test bed.}

Policy-based Internet management approaches are moving closer to maturity. Configuring a large number of routers, bridges, or servers using generic rules instead of individual configuration appears to be less complex, less error-prone and more flexible. This paper describes the design and modeling of network security agents based on policy-based framework, which has some inherent merits. The need arises for systems to coordinate with one another, to manage a range of malicious attacks across networks at any time. We performed modeling of the network components that include an intrusion detection system, firewall, single sign-on technology, and policy-based framework. The authentication for the network system access is achieved using single sign-on technology. We present modeling methodology for network security agents, which are identified as a component of policy-based network management. Each component is implemented as a hybrid design utilizing modeling concepts from Discrete EVent system Specification (DEVS) formalism and problem-solving concepts from BlackBoard Architecture (BBA) of Artificial Intelligence (AI).}

abstract = {An underwater vehicle such as a submarine or a torpedo is a complex and complicated weapon system composed of various systems and subsystems. Usually, it takes around 10years, a substantial amount of money, and many research and development resources to complete the development of an underwater vehicle, right from the concept design to the mass production. Recently, in order to reduce the number of trial-and-error instances required for verifying the operation of an underwater vehicle, modeling and simulation (M&S) has been investigated and applied to an engineering-level simulation to analyze the performance of a system and a subsystem and to an engagement-level simulation to analyze the tactical and operational effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce a method for applying fuzzy logic to the tactical decision making of an underwater vehicle in an engagement-level simulation. In the scenario of an engagement between a light torpedo pursuing a submarine and the submarine attempting to evade the attack, the evasion methods for the submarine are modeled in fuzzy logic after tacticalization. For the simulation, we modeled a light torpedo and a submarine on the basis of DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification). Further, when a tactical decision had to be taken, the submarine model calls the tactics manager implemented outside of the model and passes its own state variables, which are necessary for tactical decision making, to the tactics manager. The tactics manager used in the tactical decision making process supports Lua and the Python scripting languages and is self-implemented. The tactics description of the submarine was implemented using Python scripting grammar and stored as a Python file (∗.py) to be inputted to the tactics manager. As the simulation results, we present the implemented fuzzy Python tactic description file of the submarine evasion tactics and the possibilities of submarine survival according to the tactics as a comparison. Finally, as the fundamental research on the application of artificial intelligence to the tactical decision making method of the model used in the engagement-level simulation, this work suggests the fuzzy-based tactics description method and presents the detailed procedures for the various actions, and their adopting effectiveness.}

ARP is a stateless protocol and any IP–MAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IP–MAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IP–MAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IP–MAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IP–MAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IP–MAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed.}

Enforcing opacity in a discrete-event system, encoded by a finite labelled transition system (LTS), is a way to avoid information leakage. Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for constructing local controllers that enforces opacity for each secret separately.}

The attacker can corrupt the sensor channels that transmit the sensor readings, making the operator incapable to establish when a critical marking is reached. We first construct the stealthy attack Petri net that keeps into account the real plant evolutions observed by the attacker and the corrupted plant evolutions observed by the operator. Starting from the reachability graph of the stealthy attack Petri net, an attack structure is defined: it describes all possible attacks. The supremal stealthy attack substructure can be obtained by appropriately trimming the attack structure. An attack function is effective if the supremal stealthy attack substructure contains a state whose first element is a critical marking and the second element is a noncritical marking.}

Originally designed to increase the productivity of ICS as well as safety and reliability, nowadays these systems are becoming the target of hackers. Several attacks highlighted vulnerabilities, the most relevant one, Stuxnet, stroke in 2010. Protection of ICS against cyberattacks has to be considered. Security of these systems is different from IT security solutions because exchanged data have physical consequences. For that, a new approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in ICS was presented based on filters monitoring orders and reports. Methodology to obtain these filters and their locations in the ICS architecture were introduced. In this paper, we present major improvements in detection mechanisms of these filters. Distance concept, introduced in previous paper (Sicard et al., 2017), is developed and combined to trajectory concept that allows filters to detect deviations from expected behavior. Distance from optimal or forbidden states is essential to compute order sequence bringing back the system into safe states. Trajectory, which is the evolution of distance during state evolution, improves detection mechanism by analyzing sequences sent to the system and received by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This combinational security prevents damages against goods and people. Implementation of time based intrusion detection is a step forward for improving filters. Temporal windows indicate when actions have to be done and if received reports correspond to executed orders. Thus, our filter approach secures ICS against combinational and temporal attacks affecting security of goods and people or quality.}

In this paper we argue that, a proactive detection of spoofed IP packets will help in predicting DDoS attacks. In this paper we describe an event based detection method to identify spoofed IP packets. Our method works by proactively probing received packets for genuineness. Active probing technique uses inconsistencies in TTL values of received packets to decide whether the first packet was spoofed or genuine. We enumerate several possible spoofing scenarios with our detection method in place and identify its type based on the response to probing. Further, we study limitations of event based method and discuss ways to overcome those. We design and experiment with all spoofing scenarios in a real network setup and report the results. With few optimizations done to the probing strategy, the overhead incurred can be minimized considerably, which makes the proposed technique useful for detecting DDoS attacks.}

We address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete event systems (NDES).

In this context, a secret behavior is defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who partially observes the system’s evolution. A Petri net system is qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first search on a portion of the system’s execution. Complexity analysis and experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.}

We assume that a malicious intruder can increase the firing delay of transitions by adding delay in communication, or corrupt the transmitted data. Our target is to design a transition protecting policy to guarantee that the global performance does not drop below a given lower-bound threshold. Two classes of situations are considered: (1) the operator does not know the capability of the intruder, which means that all possible attacks must be taken into account; (2) the operator knows the upper bound of the capability of the intruder, e.g., the maximal number of transitions that can be simultaneously attacked. For the former case, we develop an algorithm using mixed integer linear programming to obtain an optimal protecting policy. For the latter situation, we develop a heuristic method to compute a protecting policy that is locally optimal.}
