abstract="This paper focuses on the problem of cyber-attacks for discrete event systems under supervisory control. In more detail, the goal of the supervisor, who has a partial observation of the system evolution, is that of preventing the system from reaching a set of unsafe states. An attacker may act in two different ways: he can corrupt the observation of the supervisor editing the sensor readings, and can enable events that are disabled by the supervisor. This is done with the aim of leading the plant to an unsafe state, and keeping the supervisor unaware of that before the unsafe state is reached. A special automaton called attack structure is constructed as the parallel composition of two special structures. Such an automaton can be used by the attacker to select appropriate actions (if any) to reach the above goal, or equivalently by the supervisor, to validate its robustness with respect to such attacks.",

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate opacity of discrete event systems. We define two types of opacities: strong opacity and weak opacity. Given a general observation mapping, a language is strongly opaque if all strings in the language are confused with some strings in another language and it is weakly opaque if some strings in the language are confused with some strings in another language. We show that security and privacy of computer systems and communication protocols can be investigated in terms of opacity. In particular, two important properties in security and privacy, namely anonymity and secrecy, can be studied as special cases of opacity. We also show that by properly specifying the languages and the observation mapping, three important properties of discrete event systems, namely observability, diagnosability, and detectability, can all be reformulated as opacity. Thus, opacity has a wide range of applications. Also in this paper we provide algorithms for checking strong opacity and weak opacity for systems described by regular languages and having a generalized projection as the observation mapping.}

Various approaches have been proposed for FDD like Analytical redundancy x0028 AR x0029, Principal component analysis x0028 PCA x0029, Discrete event system x0028 DES x0029 model etc., in the literature. Performance of FDD schemes greatly depends on accuracy of the sensors which measure the system parameters. Due to various reasons like faults, communication errors etc., sensors may occasionally miss or report erroneous values of some system parameters to FDD engine, resulting in measurement inconsistency of these parameters. Schemes like AR, PCA etc., have mechanisms to handle measurement inconsistency, however, they are computationally heavy. DES based FDD techniques are widely used because of computational simplicity, but they cannot handle measurement inconsistency efficiently. Existing DES based schemes do not use Measurement inconsistent x0028 MI x0029 parameters for FDD. These parameters are not permanently unmeasurable or erroneous, so ignoring them may lead to weak diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a Measurement inconsistent discrete event system x0028 MIDES x0029 framework, which uses MI parameters for FDD at the instances they are measured by the sensors. Otherwise, when they are unmeasurable or erroneously reported, the MIDES invokes an estimator diagnoser that predicts the statex0028 s x0029 the system is expected to be in, using the subsequent parameters measured by the other sensors. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated using a pump-valve system. In addition, an MIDES based intrusion detection system has been developed for detection of rogue dynamic host configuration protocol x0028 DHCPx0029 server attack by mapping the attack to a fault in the DES framework.<br/></div> &copy; 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

This paper proposes the use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack models presented in Carvalho et al.

abstract = {Rogue Twin Access Point (AP) is a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot/AP setup by an adversary solely with the purpose of luring Wi-Fi stations (STAs) into connecting to them. An adversary clones the Service Set IDentifier (SSID) [Hotspot Name] as well as the MAC address of the legitimate AP while setting up the rogue twin. When a STA checks for the list of available APs (under presence of rogue twin), it sees only one AP (despite there being two APs with the identical SSID and MAC address). In case the signal strength of the rogue twin is more than the legitimate AP, the STA connects to the rogue twin.In the present study, a Discrete Event System (DES) paradigm based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting rogue twin which is proposed. It overcomes many drawbacks of existing approaches in tackling rogue twin. A normal DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under normal network conditions along with a failure (attacker) DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under rogue twin network conditions is constructed. Using the knowledge of the normal and attacker DES models, a DES diagnoser is constructed to ascertain whether the frame exchange corresponds to a normal or attack condition. Even if an attacker uses multiple techniques to launch the rogue twin the proposed DES based IDS is capable of identifying all such possible instances. We validate the scheme on a real test bed.<br/> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame (s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA (s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame (s) to retrieve the buffered frame (s) of the sleeping STA (s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA (s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios.<br/></div> &copy; 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract = {6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6 connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the butter, which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic solutions and split butter approaches to intelligently guarantee butter reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before. We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared to the state of the art solutions.<br/> &copy; 2020 IEEE.},

abstract = {Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.<br/> &copy; 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">&mdash; Opacity is a security property formalizing the information leakage of a system to an external observer, namely intruder. The conventional opacity that has been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes passive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in many cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are capable of influencing the system&rsquo;s behavior beyond passive observations, need to be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the opacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a non-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has a full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the system by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this setup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion characterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state regardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore extend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity notions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the proposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on RCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be verified by constructing an observer automaton. Illustrative examples are provided throughout the paper to demonstrate the key definition and the effectiveness of the proposed opacity verification approach.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020, The Authors.

The main motives for the interest to ICS is the ease for performing cyberattacks and the potential damages inflicted to the system and its environment in case of success. The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for detecting malicious orders in discrete-event system. Four types of attacks (direct, sequential, temporal and over-soliciting) that affect an industrial system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the "automation-knowledge". Thus, by using models of system with an improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent. Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on simulation examples and an industrial platform.

abstract = {Now-a-days On-line testing becomes an indispensable part of DFT (design for testability) for detecting rapidly increasing intermittent faults in deep sub-micron ICs. Much of the proposed on-line testing techniques are for synchronous circuits as compared to asynchronous circuits. The existing online testing(OLT) techniques of asynchronous circuits involve development of checkers that verify the correctness of the predefined protocol. The area overhead of this type of checkers is quit high because of Mutex blocks, which are the main component of the checker. In this paper, we have adapted the theory of Failure Detection and Diagnosis(FDD) available in the literature on Timed Discrete Event Systems(TDES) to on-line testing of asynchronous circuits. The proposed scheme includes modeling the behavior of the circuit under normal and various stuck at fault conditions and eventually, an on-chip detector circuit is designed. The detector monitors the circuit on-line and determines whether the circuit is functioning in normal or failure mode. The main advantages of this scheme are non-intrusiveness and low area overheads compared to similar schemes reported in the literature.<br/> &copy; 2015 IEEE.},

A sensor attacker targeting on a supervised discrete event system can modify a set of sensor readings and cause the closed-loop system to reach undesirable states. In this letter, we propose a new attack detection mechanism under which the supervisor only needs to keep track of the last observable event received. Given a plant and a supervisor enforcing a state specification, we define a sensor attacker threatening if it may cause the closed-loop system to enter a forbidden state. Our goal is to verify whether there exists such a threatening sensor attacker for a given controlled system. A new structure, called All Sensor Attack (ASA), is proposed to capture all possible sensor attacks launched by the attacker. Based on the ASA automaton, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a stealthy threatening sensor attacker is presented. Finally, we show that the condition can be verified in polynomial time.<br/></div> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">System resilience captures the ability of the system to withstand a major disruption within acceptable performance degradation and to recover within an acceptable time frame. In this monograph we consider two possible sources of major disruptions, i.e., component faults and cyber intrusions. A component fault is an indigenous activity that renders unavailability or inaccessibility of certain functions within a component, either permanently or temporarily. It typically generates safety and performance concerns. Cyber intrusion on the other hand is an exogenous activity that tampers privacy, confidentiality, availability, or integrity of the system. These two sources are not always independent from each other. For example, a cyber intrusion may trigger a component fault, whereas a component fault may open a door for cyber intrusion, e.g., by keeping it undetected. For cyber intrusion, we will focus on opacity, which describes the system's ability to hide certain secrets from an external observer (or eavesdropper), and sensor and actuator attacks that exploit the system's existing controller to generate undesirable behaviours. In this monograph, we provide a detailed account of most recent research outcomes on fault diagnosis, opacity analysis and enhancement, and cyber security analysis and enforcement, within suitable discrete event system modelling frame-works. In each case, we describe basic problem statements and key concepts, and then point out the key challenges in each research area. After that, we present a thorough review of state-of-the-art techniques, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

In this paper we focus on Minimal De-authentication (de-auth henceforth) DoS Attack which is a low rate de-auth DoS attack in Wi-Fi networks. There exist studies which can tackle flooding based de-auth DoS, however, there has been limited work done in the case for minimal de-auth DoS attack. The network frame exchange under minimal de-auth DoS attack and normal de-auth process is the same, making the detection even more challenging. Since minimal de-auth DoS attack involves sending only a few spoofed de-auth frames into the network, no significant frame injection can be observed in the network. So the contemporary signature and anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) fail to recognize the minimal de-auth DoS attack. In this paper, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based IDS for detecting minimal de-auth DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS provides a novel detection method and does not require any protocol changes, or require any server/client side changes and can be proved for completeness and correctness. Experiments results show that the proposed DES based IDS detects minimal de-auth DoS attack swiftly and with high accuracy.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 IEEE.},

In comparison to the relatively closed and secure production environment of traditional industries, the industrial internet faces significant security challenges in terms of data privacy. This paper investigates the privacy-preserving control problem for data opacity of the industrial internet to provide a resilient defending strategy against cyber threats, where the system to be controlled is modeled as a networked discrete-event system (DES) and malicious eavesdroppers exist to infer the system secret based on its observations. We here aim at designing a networked supervisor to achieve the following two objectives: (1) eavesdroppers cannot infer the system secret based on its observations, which is formulated as the requirement of opacity enforcement, (2) under the control of the designed networked supervisor, the system could still achieve the predetermined control requirement. To solve the previously mentioned privacy-preserving supervisory control problem, this paper first proposes a privacy-preserving control architecture for networked DES, in which each component is modeled as a finite-state automaton to simulate its dynamics. We design an algorithm based on the constructed models to synthesize the networked supervisor by transforming the original privacy-preserving control problem into a classical Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control problem. Furthermore, this paper proves (1) the designed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and (2) the existence of the supremal networked supervisor for this privacy-preserving supervisory control problem.<br/></div> &copy; 2022, Science Press.

We first introduce usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable events with at least a certain security level, and the highest usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES. Moreover, we extend the problem to the case of heterogeneous secrets with different levels of importance, and develop an algorithm to solve this extended problem.

Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the controller. In this article, we consider that such communication is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state. We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function, i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple objectives. Our solution methodology is based on mapping these problems to optimal control problems for Markov decision processes, specifically, a probabilistic reachability problem and a stochastic shortest path problem.<br/></div> &copy; 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The solution methodology proposed in this work is to solve the covert sensor attack synthesis problem for networked DES by modeling it as the well studied Ramadge-Wonham supervisor synthesis problem, and the constructions work for both the damage-reachable attacks and the damage-nonblocking attacks.

The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment.<br/></div> &copy; 2017},

However, they are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack, the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin attacks in a Wi-Fi network.<br/> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

It then follows that it is possible to use the many techniques and tools already developed for solving the supervisor synthesis problem to solve the covert actuator attacker synthesis problem for free. In particular, we show that, if the attacker cannot attack unobservable events to the supervisor, then the reductions can be carried out in polynomial time. We also provide a brief discussion on some other conditions under which the exponential blowup in state size can be avoided. Finally, we show how the reduction based synthesis procedure can be extended for the synthesis of successful covert actuator attackers that also eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2019, The Authors.

However, considering that the system is constrained, ensuring security is a challenge when employing CoAP since it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is unrealiable and lacks handshaking mechanism. A malicious endpoint with read and write access can severly jeopardize service availability by launching an IP address spoofed attack. Moreover, it can help mount other complex Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks like amplification attacks. Though response spoofing vulnerability has been addressed in the research community for quite some time now, request spoofing countermeasures are relatively few. In this paper, we propose an attacker identification scheme using a Discrete Event System (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Through our scheme, we not only detect request and response spoofing attack in CoAP, but also identify the adversarial node by analysing the LoWPAN event dynamics generated due to probe responses. Correctness of our approach is guaranteed by construction of a DES diagnoser. We have tested our approach on Contiki OS. The experimental results show our proposed scheme to be energy efficient with response time of approx 6 sec at 99.2% accuracy.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 IEEE.},

A discrete event system is current-state opaque if an intruder is never able to verify whether the current state of the system is within the secret states. This article addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable transitions and propose an approach for the verification of current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets. It is shown by experimental studies that the symbolic approach is practically more efficient than traditional techniques such as basis reachability graphs (BRGs).<br/></div> &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

Given a discrete event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph, new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity.

The supervisor&rsquo;s goal is to enforce a specific language in spite of the opponent&rsquo;s actions and without knowing which adversary it is playing against. This problem is motivated by applications to computer security in which a cyber defense system must make decisions based on reports from sensors that may have been tampered with by an attacker. We start by showing that the problem has a solution if and only if the desired language is controllable (in the Discrete event system classical sense) and observable in a (novel) sense that takes the adversaries into account. For the particular case of attacks that insert symbols into or remove symbols from the sequence of sensor outputs, we show that testing the existence of a supervisor and building the supervisor can be done using tools developed for the classical DES supervisory control problem, by considering a family of automata with modified output maps, but without expanding the size of the state space and without incurring on exponential complexity on the number of attacks considered.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2017, The Authors.

This is due to the communication networks between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors, which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or devices that are not sufficiently protected.

abstract = {Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for determining the link layer or Medium Access Control (MAC) address of a network host, given its Internet Layer (IP) or Network Layer address. ARP is a stateless protocol and any IPMAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IPMAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IPMAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IPMAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IPMAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IPMAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed. &copy; 2010 ISA.

abstract = {Initial-state estimation consists in determining the initial state of the system based on the observation from the system and the system structure. It is the basis for many problems in security applications, such as opacity, detectability and supervisory control. However, when it comes to cyber-physical systems (CPS) communication delays and losses are inevitable. In this letter, we study the initial-state estimation problem in a CPS that is modeled with a multi-channel networked discrete event system (NDES). In practice, the system is usually distributed over several locations, and the communication between the system and an agent (e.g., intruder, observer, supervisor) is carried out via a shared network, in which communication delays and losses may happen. In multi-channel NDESs, even when the first-in first-out rule is satisfied in each channel, the order of events received by the agent may still be shuffled due to random communication delays in each channel. To address these new challenges, we formalize the initial-state estimation problem in multi-channel NDESs and a networked initial-state estimator is proposed to generate the exact initial-state estimate.<br/> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

Various notions of opacity have received significant attention during the last decade including current state opacity and initial state opacity, which have been studied for deterministic and probabilistic systems in untimed contexts. In timed systems, opacity requirements may vary with time and one could also be interested in knowing the time duration for which opacity requirements are violated or preserved. The main contribution of this article is to introduce and analyze opacity exposure and opacity revelation times as measures of vulnerability in timed discrete event system (DES) that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., at any given time, all enabled events are independent and distributed in time with exponential probability density functions). Labeled stochastic Petri nets (LSPNs) are used to model timed stochastic DESs, and appropriate constructions (involving current and initial state observers) are used to evaluate exposure and revelation times for a given LSPN.<br/></div> &copy; 1963-2012 IEEE.},

Enforcing opacity in a discrete-event system, encoded by a finite labelled transition system (LTS), is a way to avoid information leakage. Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for constructing local controllers that enforces opacity for each secret separately.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020 The Authors.},

abstract = {The diagnosability condition for a Discrete Event System (DES) model requires that there exists no failureindeterminate cycles in the DES diagnoser for all failure types. This stringent requirement of DES diagnosability condition renders many systems non-diagnosable. I-diagnosability framework provides a weaker notion of diagnosability than DES diagnosability by considering only those failures that are followed by certain observable event(s) known as indicator events. However, some systems are I-non-diagnosable even in the presence of an indicator event following the failure event. In this paper, we propose I<sup>2</sup>-diagnosability framework overcomes the shortcomings of the I-diagnosability framework. In I<sup>2</sup>-DES framework an empowering event ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully.

The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker, assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and results in a "local"symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e., only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a certain total cost.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 EUCA.},

This article deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners - Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state, recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs), introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).<br/></div> &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The various fields of application for miniature air vehicles often do not provide distinct landing areas or even require additional equipment like nets or parachutes to land the aircraft without damaging it. This work introduces the deep stall landing (DSL) as a maneuver that uses the extraordinary aerodynamic characteristics of a delta wing MAV that come into effect after the angle of attack passes the stall angle. This landing maneuver is modeled based on a longitudinal aerodynamic model that takes lift, drag, thrust, weight, and pitching moment into account. By determining the operational modes that the aircraft has to perform in order to either complete the landing maneuver or abort it in case of a missed approach a hybrid system is identified. This system contains both continuous and discrete state dynamics that model the aircraft in each landing phase. Based on this hybrid system reachability analyses are performed which utilize level set methods to calculate backwards reachable sets. These sets are used to identify transitions within the modeled system that bring the aircraft form one operational mode to another without leaving the safe flight envelope. The final result is a discrete event system that covers all possible transitions within the refined model. Based on this discrete model an autonomous system can be implemented that is able to determine whether the initiation of the landing maneuver is safe in terms of keeping the aircraft within the safe flight envelope during the whole maneuver. Furthermore the results of the reachability analysis determine for which states of the aircraft it would be safe to initiate a recovery maneuver in case of a missed landing approach. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},

RPL constructs DODAGs (destination oriented directed acyclic graphs), to optimize routing. RPL ensures acyclic topology with the DODAG version number. However, the control message&rsquo;s DODAG version number is not authenticated. So, RPL is vulnerable to network resource attack known as DODAG Version Number (DVN) attack. DVN attack creates a packet delay, packet loss, cyclic topology, etc., in the network. This paper proposes a method for detecting DODAG version number attacks. Several existing schemes to defend against the DVN, such as cryptographic techniques, trust-based, threshold-based and mitigation are computationally intensive or require protocol modification. DVN does not change the packet format or sequence of packets, but can still perform attacks and hence fall under the category of stealthy attacks, which are difficult to detect using traditional intrusion detection system&rsquo;s (IDS). Discrete-event system (DES) based IDS have been applied in the literature for stealthy attacks that achieve low overhead, low false alarm rate, etc. However, the construction of DES-based IDS for network protocol may lead to errors, as modelling is manual. The resulting IDS, therefore, is unable to guarantee its correctness. This paper proposes linear temporal logic (LTL) based DES paradigm to detect DVN. LTL-based paradigm facilitates formal verification of the DES-based IDS, and hence the correctness of the scheme is ascertained. The proposed technique is simulated using the Contiki cooja simulator. When the percentage of spiteful nodes in the network increases, the true positive rate, and packet delivery rate drops, while the false positive rate and control message overhead increase. The memory requirement for sending the packets and verifying the nodes is minimal. The LTL-based IDS has been formally verified using NuSMV to ensure the correctness of the framework.<br/></div> &copy; 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.},

DAD scheme is susceptible to neighbor advertisement and neighbor solicitation spoofing attacks because ICMPv6 control messages lack in authentication. Existing strategies against the DAD attack have major drawbacks, e.g., high computation, non-scalability, requirement of protocol modification etc. This paper presents a strategy for detecting DAD attack using Conjunctive Normal Form-based Discrete Event System diagnoser. DES-based intrusion detection system have shown effective results in terms of features, like no change in protocol, low overhead etc. against network attacks. The primary drawback of the DES-based IDS is the diagnosis process, which necessitates synchronization of two or more state-based models, making it computationally expensive. To address this issue, CNF-based DES diagnoser scheme is proposed that has all the advantages of DES-based IDS and at the same time addresses the complexity issues. The CNF diagnoser also facilitates the diagnosability verification. The proposed CNF-based IDS for DAD attack is implemented in a testbed and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness in terms of minimal resource consumption, 100% accuracy, high detection rate, less processing time and low traffic overhead.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message. A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property.

The proposed method is a two-fold process: a preliminary verification of critical observability for the underlying logic labeled Petri net and a further verification considering the time constraint associated with each transition. The first step is based on the concurrent composition of a reachability graph of the logic net. If the logic net is critically observable, then the time net is also critically observable at any given time instant. Otherwise, the second step is to design an algorithm to compute all pairs of transition-class sequences that violate critical observability at the given time instant, and then a set of linear programming problems is exploited to check critical observability for the corresponding timed system. Note to Practitioners-Timed discrete event systems provide a theoretical model for safety-critical real applications such as air traffic management, smart grid, and industrial control, which are vulnerable to malicious attack and destruction at some particular time instants such that a system may be misled to dangerous states. Critical observability of a timed discrete event system is a property with which the predefined dangerous states can be determined and detected from the observation by an observer at a given time instant. This research aims to offer a systematic approach to check critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets, which can also present some new ideas and insights for practitioners in the field of safety-critical systems.<br/></div> &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Opacity is an important property asking whether a passive observer (an intruder), who knows the structure of the system but has only a limited observation of its behavior, may reveal the secret of the system. Several notions of opacity have been studied in the literature, including current-state opacity, k-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity. We investigate weak and strong k-step opacity, the notions that generalize both current-state opacity and infinite-step opacity, and ask whether the intruder is not able to decide, at any instant, when respectively whether the system was in a secret state during the last k observable steps. We design a new algorithm to verify weak k-step opacity, the complexity of which is lower than that of existing algorithms and that does not depend on the parameter k. Then, we show how to use this algorithm to verify strong k-step opacity by reducing the verification of strong k-step opacity to the verification of weak k-step opacity. The complexity of the resulting approach is again better than that of existing algorithms, and does not depend on the parameter k.}

Stealthy cyber-attacks that may alter the control symbols, i.e., the orders sent by the controllers to the actuators, are considered. The objective is to construct an observer that uses both input and output information to provide a state estimation of the system under such stealthy actuators attacks. This observer provides a refined state estimation related to both normal and attack conditions.}

We consider a maze solving problem in which two agents must search an unknown maze as fast and as securely as possible. We formulate this problem using a discrete-event systems framework and present a coordination strategy for two agents to search a simple maze that involves no communication, thereby eliminating any cyber-security threats. Our strategy involves two agents having reverse priority decision-making policies, while searching the maze with a depth-first search control policy. Under our definition of inefficiency, which is a function of the number of dead end states that are searched by both agents, we show that our method achieves the minimum inefficiency cost, and thus performs as well as any communication-based solution.}

abstract = {Resilience is a critical criterion to evaluate a networked system including discrete-event systems (DESs). This research touches upon the supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption. Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated through examples.}

Roughly speaking, a system is said to be opaque if the intruder, which is modeled by a passive observer, can never determine the “secret” of the system for sure. Most of the existing notions of opacity consider secrets related to the actual behaviors of the system. In this paper, we consider a new type of secret related to the knowledge of the system user. Specifically, we assume that the system user also only has partial observation of the system and has to reason the actual behavior of the system. We say a system is high-order opaque if the intruder can never determine that the system user knows some information of importance based on its own incomparable information. We provide the formal definition of high-order opacity. Two algorithms are provided for the verification of this new notion: one with doubly-exponential complexity for the worst case and the other with single-exponential complexity. Illustrative examples are provided for the new notion of high-order opacity.}

The general purpose for multi-agent coordination is to synthesize a plan such that the LTL task is achieved optimally. In addition to the standard requirement on the correctness of the plan, we further investigate the potential information leakage of each agent during the operating process. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the behavior of each individual agent is partially monitored by a passive intruder modeled as an outside observer or an eavesdropper. The security constraint requires that the intruder can never identify for sure that some specific individual agent is carrying out some sub-tasks of significant importance. To this end, we model the mobile capability of the agent team by a global labeled transition system. To describe information-flow security constraint, motivated by the generic notion of opacity, two different types security requirements are proposed for each individual agent. An effective coordination algorithm is proposed that synthesizes an optimal global plan for the entire agent team such that the global LTL task can be achieved, while the security of each individual agent is preserved. The proposed framework is implemented in real-world experiment and is also demonstrated by several case studies.}

Random control delays may occur in such networked systems, hence the control of the supervisor could be affected. Furthermore, there is an attacker targeting the vulnerable actuators. The attacker can corrupt the control input generated by the supervisor, and aims at driving the plant to unsafe states. We propose a new approach to model the closed-loop system subject to control delays and attacks. The notion of AE-safe controllability in the networked control system is defined: it describes the ability to prevent the plant from reaching unsafe states after attacks are detected. A method for testing AE-safe controllability is also presented.}

The design objective is to synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even though the control policy is publicly known. We propose to use non-deterministic supervisors, provides a set of control decisions at each instant, to enforce opacity. Such a non-deterministic control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision cannot be implicitly inferred from the control policy. We provide an effective approach to synthesize a non-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. We show that non-deterministic supervisors are strictly more powerful than deterministic supervisors.}

abstract = {Opacity is an important information-flow security property that characterizes the plausible deniability of a dynamic system for its “secret” against eavesdropping attacks. As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous “hold on” events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations.}

abstract = {In many security applications, system behaviors must be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (intruders). Opacity was first studied for discrete event systems, and then it was extended to real-time systems. One of the challenges of real-time systems is the difficulty to guarantee their opacity against a potential attacker. In general, this property is undecidable for systems modeled by timed automata. A secret location, S, of a system is timed opaque to an intruder having partial observability of the system, if the intruder can never infer from the observation of any execution that the system has reached any secret location. In the present study, the static partial observability for systems modeled by nondeterministic timed automata is investigated. Thus, it focuses on systems where the timing of secret state reachability is bounded. The first contribution of this study is to define the bounded timed opacity property wherein, its complexity is proved. The second contribution is to consider systems where the secret should be kept hidden for a certain period referred to as the Δ-duration bounded opacity property. Also, a formal definition is proposed and its complexity is proved. In addition, the proposed properties are verified using timed bounded model checking. A case study ”Exchange in the Cloud system” is modeled by timed automaton to verify the proposed properties using SpaceEx tool.}

abstract = {The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization (OO) is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at “order” in performances among designs instead of “value” and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the OO solution, is a key step in applying the OO method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended.}

This paper proposes the use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack models presented in Carvalho et al.

This work deals with the problem of current-state opacity formulation and verification in the context of discrete event systems modelled with partially observed Petri nets (POPNs) (i.e., Petri nets containing place sensors that measure the number of tokens in observable places and event sensors that indicate the firing of observable transitions). A Petri net system is recognized as current-state opaque if the current-state estimate is never entirely contained in the set of secret states. In this regard, we introduce the notion of discernible markings to design a reduced state estimator called a discernible reachability graph, and then come up with formal modelling of current-state opacity in POPN systems. The main idea of the proposed approach consists in proving that if a system is current-state opaque, its current-state estimate, possibly established by an intruder, contains at least one non-secret state. We exploit the mathematical feasibility to formulate this concept by defining and solving an integer linear programming problem with respect to a given secret and an observation sequence collected from sensors. In the light of the proposed modelling, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for opacity verification, and examples are given to expose the results.}

In our k-memory-embedded insertion mechanism, the insertion functions are determined based on the knowledge of system’s exact states and the stored next sequence of events with length k. Especially, we define the property of ik-E-enforceability that a k-memory-embedded insertion function needs to satisfy for opacity enforcement, and further construct a verifier to determine whether a given opacity notion of the system is ik-E-enforceable or not. Our mechanism improves the embedded insertion mechanism by applying to a broader class of systems.

Strong infinite-step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred by an intruder at any instance along the entire observation trajectory, while strong k-step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred within k steps after the visit. We propose two information structures called an ∞-step recognizer and a k-step recognizer to verify these two properties. The complexities of our algorithms to verify strong infinite- and k-step opacity are O(22⋅|X|⋅|Eo|) and O(2(k+2)⋅|X|⋅|Eo|), respectively, which are lower than that of existing methods in the literature (|X| and |Eo| are the numbers of states and observable events in a plant, respectively). We also derive an upper bound for the value of k in strong k-step opacity, and propose an effective algorithm to determine the maximal value of k for a given plant.

We study this problem at the supervisory layer of the control system, using discrete event systems techniques. The attacker can edit the outputs from the sensors of the system before they reach the supervisory controller as well as it can edit actuator commands before they reach the system. In this context, we formulate the problem of synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large class of edit attacks on the sensor readings and actuator commands. Intuitively, we search for a supervisor that guarantees the safety of the system even when sensor readings and actuator commands are compromised. Given the similarities of the investigated problem to the standard supervisory control problem, our solution methodology reduces the problem of synthesizing a robust supervisor against deception attacks to a supervisory control problem. This new and intuitive solution methodology improves upon prior work on this topic.}

The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment.}

Specifically, a system is infinite-step opaque if the entrance of the system state at any particular instant to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain), for the length of the system operation, to an intruder who observes system activity through some projection map. In other words, based on observations through this map (and complete knowledge of the system model), the intruder can never be certain (and will never be certain) that the system state at any point in time evolves (or has evolved) to the set of secret states. We show that infinite-step opacity can be verified via the construction of a set of appropriate state estimators.

Initial-state opacity requires that the membership of the system initial state to a given set of secret states S remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder who has complete knowledge of the system model and observes system activity through some natural projection map. In the modular setting we consider, the given system is modeled as a composition (synchronous product) of M modules [G1, G2, …, GM] where each module Gi is a non-deterministic finite automaton with Ni states with the set of secret states S is of the form S = [(x1, x2, …, xM)|xi Si], where Si is the set of secret states for module Gi. Assuming that the pairwise shared events are pairwise observable and that the intruder observes events that are observable in at least one module, we provide a modular algorithm for verifying initial-state opacity with O(MNM–12N2) state and time complexity, where N = maxi Ni. This is a considerable reduction compared to the O(2(NM)2) state and time complexity of the centralized verification method, which verifies initial-state opacity by considering the composed system as a monolithic system.}

The proposed approach to verify the current-state opacity works on-line: the verification algorithm waits for the occurrence of an observable event and uses Integer Linear Programming problem solutions to verify if the behavior of the system is current-state opaque to the intruder under the given observation. Moreover, the proposed method is applied in two different settings: (i) a centralized approach where the intruder has full knowledge of the system model but can partially observe the system behavior; (ii) a decentralized approach where a set of intruders can observe different event sets and collaborate with a coordinator to disclose the same secret. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.}

In these systems, deadlocks are defined as blocking states where no resource allocation decision can be taken. They originate from resources characteristics (i.e. mutual exclusion condition, non-preemptive), processes interactions (i.e. shared resources, circular wait of resources) and an inappropriate sequence of allocation decisions. In modern FMSs, the use of open and interconnected control components for resource allocation control and productivity enhancement makes FMSs vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Hence, although FMSs are designed to deal with known natural deadlocks, new malicious ones can originate from sophisticated cyber-attacks. In this paper, malicious deadlocks are defined and contextualized regarding the existing literature on deadlocks management and on cyber-attacks targeting Discrete-Event Systems (DES). Then, a model representative of deadlock attacks is proposed based on the S3PR theory and DES attacks modeling.

This work touches upon the opacity problem in discrete event systems modeled with labeled Petri nets, by assuming the existence of an active intruder. Herein, an active intruder, whose abilities exceed passive observations, is assumed to be able to manipulate the behavior of a system through sensor attacks in a practical manner, i.e., in an embedded way, in order to compromise the opacity of a system. In this setting, a framework for opacity verification is first proposed from the intruder’s viewpoint, where opacity is referred to as “language-based opacity”. A verification algorithm is then derived to identify opaque secret words. Two stealthy attack models named sensor-failure-making strategy and sensor-injection-making strategy are introduced, allowing the intruder to implant/damage some sensors, i.e., add/delete some events, in line with the original behavior of a system, in order to infer the secret information. An algorithmic procedure for attractability analysis is provided for each attack strategy. Once a system is proved to be attackable, a stealthy attack structure that synthesizes different sensor-failure-making (resp. sensor-injection-making) attacks is constructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed approaches by implementing the presented algorithms and running experiments on a manufacturing system example.}

Originally designed to increase the productivity of ICS as well as safety and reliability, nowadays these systems are becoming the target of hackers. Several attacks highlighted vulnerabilities, the most relevant one, Stuxnet, stroke in 2010. Protection of ICS against cyberattacks has to be considered. Security of these systems is different from IT security solutions because exchanged data have physical consequences. For that, a new approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in ICS was presented based on filters monitoring orders and reports. Methodology to obtain these filters and their locations in the ICS architecture were introduced. In this paper, we present major improvements in detection mechanisms of these filters. Distance concept, introduced in previous paper (Sicard et al., 2017), is developed and combined to trajectory concept that allows filters to detect deviations from expected behavior. Distance from optimal or forbidden states is essential to compute order sequence bringing back the system into safe states. Trajectory, which is the evolution of distance during state evolution, improves detection mechanism by analyzing sequences sent to the system and received by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This combinational security prevents damages against goods and people. Implementation of time based intrusion detection is a step forward for improving filters. Temporal windows indicate when actions have to be done and if received reports correspond to executed orders. Thus, our filter approach secures ICS against combinational and temporal attacks affecting security of goods and people or quality.}

The attacker can corrupt the sensor channels that transmit the sensor readings, making the operator incapable to establish when a critical marking is reached. We first construct the stealthy attack Petri net that keeps into account the real plant evolutions observed by the attacker and the corrupted plant evolutions observed by the operator. Starting from the reachability graph of the stealthy attack Petri net, an attack structure is defined: it describes all possible attacks. The supremal stealthy attack substructure can be obtained by appropriately trimming the attack structure. An attack function is effective if the supremal stealthy attack substructure contains a state whose first element is a critical marking and the second element is a noncritical marking.}

In some sense, these models are the simplest models of (deadlock-free) systems. Although the expressivity of such systems is weaker than the expressivity of linear temporal logic, we show that the opacity verification for these systems is still hard.}

We address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete event systems (NDES). To this end, we propose an automaton model for NDES subject to DoS-D attacks that represents the adverse effects of DoS-D attacks on the observations of local diagnosers. We introduce a new codiagnosability definition called DoS-D-robust codiagnosability, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be DoS-D-robustly codiagnosable.

We model this as a Discrete Event Systems supervisory control problem, involving a model of the plant’s possible behaviors, a model of considered attacks, and a formulation of the control objectives.

In this context, a secret behavior is defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who partially observes the system’s evolution. A Petri net system is qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first search on a portion of the system’s execution. Complexity analysis and experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.}

In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system’s output behavior by inserting additional observable events. We define the property of “i-enforceability” that an insertion function needs to satisfy in order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion function’s ability to respond to every system’s observed behavior and to output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing a structure called the “All Insertion Structure” (AIS). The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.}

A system equipped with a dynamic mask, which acquires information dynamically by turning sensors on/off, is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all information acquired can never infer that the system was at some secret state for some specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem only consider current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for infinite-step opacity, a notion stronger than current-state opacity, is much more challenging. The main reason is that delayed information is involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret will be revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture all delayed information in the infinite-step opacity problem. An effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem. Our result extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity.}

However, in networked discrete event systems (NDESs), the DESs run in a shared network, and the communication delays and losses are inevitable usually. In this paper, we investigate the problems of opacity in the framework of NDESs. We formulate four kinds of opacity for NDESs, including current-state opacity, initial-state opacity, initial-final-state opacity, and K-step opacity. We also present the verification algorithms for these notions. We extend the notions of opacity in classical DESs, that is, if the communication delays and losses disappear, then these new notions would reduce to their classical counterparts.

The intruder is characterized as a passive external observer whose malicious goal is to infer system secrets from observed traces of system events. We consider the problems of enforcing opacity under the assumption that the intruder either knows or does not know the structure of the insertion function; we term this requirement as public–private enforceability. The case of private enforceability alone, where the intruder does not know the form of the insertion function, is solved in our prior work. In this paper, we address the stronger requirement of public–private enforceability, that requires opacity be preserved even if the intruder knows or discovers the structure of the insertion function. We formulate the concept of public–private enforceability by defining the notion of public safety. This leads to the notion of public–private enforcing (PP-enforcing) insertion functions. We then identify a necessary and sufficient condition for an insertion function to be PP-enforcing. We further show that if opacity is privately enforceable by the insertion mechanism, then it is also public–private enforceable. Using these results, we present a new algorithm to synthesize PP-enforcing insertion functions by a greedy-maximal strategy. This algorithm is the first of its kind to guarantee opacity when insertion functions are made public or discovered by the intruder.}

In this work, we study the problem of decentralized fault prognosis in the context of partially-observed DESs. Different from existing results, we establish algebraic structures of given systems under decentralized agents by semi-tensor product rather than observers or verifiers based on formal language methods. The structure matrices of decentralized partially-observed DESs are polynomial in the size of a given system and linear about the number of agents. Besides, combining the formal method and algebraic state space approach, we discuss three kinds of coprognosability, called (M,K)-disjunctive-coprognosability aiming at disjunctive architectures, (M,K)-conjunctive-coprognosability for conjunctive architectures and (M,K)-strongly-coprognosability focusing on general structures, respectively. Here, (M,K) is the performance bound of a given prognostic system. In order to take both fault prediction and isolation into consideration, the decentralized prognoser is required to issue the “j” alarm for the jth type of fault and “0” means no fault alarm. Meanwhile, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to verify each kind of coprognosability based on the structure matrix approach and show that each verification is not separate.}

We then propose a defense strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of unsafe system states.

abstract = {Opacity is an important information security property. Given a discrete event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph, new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity. The proposed approaches are shown to be more efficient than the standard methods based on the reachability graph.}

An attacker may act in two different ways: it can corrupt the observation of the supervisor by editing the sensor readings, and it can enable events that have been disabled by the supervisor. This is done with the aim of leading the plant to an unsafe state. A special automaton, called attack structure is constructed as the parallel composition of two special structures: an attacker observer and a supervisor under attack. Such an automaton can be used by the attacker to select proper actions (if any) to lead the plant to reach the unsafe state.}

We present new algorithms for the verification of the properties of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity for partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as finite-state automata. Our new algorithms are based on a novel separation principle for state estimates that characterizes the information dependence in opacity verification problems, and they have lower computational complexity than previously-proposed ones in the literature. Specifically, we propose a new information structure, called the two-way observer, that is used for the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity.

We propose a cryptographic scheme to be applied in an automation network which cipher events without altering the size or structure of the transmitted data. In addition, the proposed cryptographic scheme leads to small communication delays, which makes it suitable for application in automation networks. We call this scheme event-based cryptography, where an event is defined as any change in the binary signals transmitted in the network. In order to do so, we propose a method for the codification of events as event vectors, which is suitable for encryption. We also propose the use of a stream cipher called ChaCha20, which is known to have a high resistance to cryptanalysis. A simulated example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed event-based cryptography, and to make a comparison with the RSA cipher, a public-key cipher widely used in Information Technology.}

We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker’s point of view, and formulate an attack-with-bounded-sensor-reading-alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be computed, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which computes a supervisor that is ABSRA-robust in the sense that any ABSRA will either be detectable or inflict no damage to the system.}

We first introduce usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable events with at least a certain security level, and the highest usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES. Moreover, we extend the problem to the case of heterogeneous secrets with different levels of importance, and develop an algorithm to solve this extended problem.

Given a set of system states (the secret), a system observation is called initial-state opaque if an agent (named intruder), who can partially observe the system, cannot determine whether the set of initial states consistent with an event sequence is included in the secret. Such a character can describe security problems in cyber-infrastructures, such as Internet and mobile communication networks or national defense service systems. This work presents a novel on-line methodology to verify the notion of initial-state opacity of discrete event systems that are modeled by labeled Petri nets. By working on-line, the intruder records an event and exploits integer linear programming problem for checking the initial-state opacity of the system’s evolution under the given observation. A set of examples are shown to shed light on the efficiency of the presented methodology.}

There is a malicious intruder attempting to infer secrets of the system from its observations. To prevent the disclosure of secrets, the insertion function inserts fictitious events to the output of the system to obfuscate the intruder. The system is initialized with several types of resources, referred to as energy. The energy is consumed or replenished with event occurrences while always consumed with event insertions. The insertion function must enforce opacity while ensuring that each type of resource is never depleted. This problem is then reduced to a two-player game between the insertion function and the system (environment), with properly defined objectives. A game structure called the Energy Insertion Structure, denoted by EIS is proposed, which provably contains solutions to the energy constrained opacity enforcement problem. Then we further study the bounded cost rate insertion problem on the insertion function’s winning region of EIS, which requires that the long run average rate of insertion cost be bounded. This problem is formulated as a multidimensional mean payoff game and a special method called hyperplane separation technique is applied to efficiently solve it.}

ARP is a stateless protocol and any IP–MAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IP–MAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IP–MAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IP–MAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IP–MAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IP–MAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed.}

Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for constructing local controllers that enforces opacity for each secret separately.}

Among many different notions of opacity, K-step opacity requires that the intruder can never determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret state for any specific instant within K steps prior to that particular instant. This notion becomes infinity-step opacity when K goes to infinity. Existing works on the analysis of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a system is either opaque or non-opaque. To analyze infinite-step and K-step opacity more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity in the context of stochastic discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost infinite-step opacity (respectively, almost K-step opacity), is proposed to capture whether or not the probability of violating infinite-step opacity (respectively, K-step opacity) is smaller than a given threshold. We also provide effective algorithms for the verification of almost infinite-step opacity and almost K-step opacity.}

The attacks considered in this paper include arbitrary deletions, insertions, or substitutions of observed symbols. Assuming that each deletion, insertion, or substitution bears a positive cost to the attacker, two scenarios are taken into account: (1) a bounded number of attacks or, more generally, a total cost constraint on tampering actions; (2) an infinite number of attacks or, more generally, no constraints on the total cost of tampering actions. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the influence of cost constraints on tamper-tolerant diagnosis and tamper-tolerant system diagnosability.}

In DDoS attack several machines send large amount of network traffic to the victim using spoofed IP address. Unfortunately there is no reliable technique to detect spoofed IP packets. In this paper we argue that, a proactive detection of spoofed IP packets will help in predicting DDoS attacks. In this paper we describe an event based detection method to identify spoofed IP packets. Our method works by proactively probing received packets for genuineness. Active probing technique uses inconsistencies in TTL values of received packets to decide whether the first packet was spoofed or genuine. We enumerate several possible spoofing scenarios with our detection method in place and identify its type based on the response to probing. Further, we study limitations of event based method and discuss ways to overcome those. We design and experiment with all spoofing scenarios in a real network setup and report the results. With few optimizations done to the probing strategy, the overhead incurred can be minimized considerably, which makes the proposed technique useful for detecting DDoS attacks.}

A system is initial-state opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret states remains opaque (i.e., uncertain) to an intruder who observes system activity through some projection map. Initial-state opacity can be used to characterize security requirements in a variety of applications, including tracking problems in sensor networks. In order to model and analyze the intruder capabilities regarding initial-state opacity, we first address the initial-state estimation problem in a non-deterministic finite automaton via the construction of an initial-state estimator. We analyze the properties and complexity of the initial-state estimator, and show how the complexity of the verification method can be greatly reduced in the special case when the set of secret states is invariant. We also establish that the verification of initial-state opacity is a PSPACE-complete problem.}

One necessary and sufficient condition to check LBO by solving Integer Linear Programming problems is given; such a condition exploits the algebraic representation of Petri nets. A sufficient condition is then derived, which is less demanding from the computational point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of examples.}

We assume that a malicious intruder can increase the firing delay of transitions by adding delay in communication, or corrupt the transmitted data. Our target is to design a transition protecting policy to guarantee that the global performance does not drop below a given lower-bound threshold. Two classes of situations are considered: (1) the operator does not know the capability of the intruder, which means that all possible attacks must be taken into account; (2) the operator knows the upper bound of the capability of the intruder, e.g., the maximal number of transitions that can be simultaneously attacked. For the former case, we develop an algorithm using mixed integer linear programming to obtain an optimal protecting policy. For the latter situation, we develop a heuristic method to compute a protecting policy that is locally optimal.}

DAD scheme is susceptible to neighbor advertisement and neighbor solicitation spoofing attacks because ICMPv6 control messages lack in authentication. Existing strategies against the DAD attack have major drawbacks, e.g., high computation, non-scalability, requirement of protocol modification etc. This paper presents a strategy for detecting DAD attack using Conjunctive Normal Form-based Discrete Event System diagnoser. DES-based intrusion detection system have shown effective results in terms of features, like no change in protocol, low overhead etc. against network attacks. The primary drawback of the DES-based IDS is the diagnosis process, which necessitates synchronization of two or more state-based models, making it computationally expensive. To address this issue, CNF-based DES diagnoser scheme is proposed that has all the advantages of DES-based IDS and at the same time addresses the complexity issues. The CNF diagnoser also facilitates the diagnosability verification. The proposed CNF-based IDS for DAD attack is implemented in a testbed and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness in terms of minimal resource consumption, 100% accuracy, high detection rate, less processing time and low traffic overhead.}

We investigate weak and strong k-step opacity, the notions that generalize both current-state opacity and infinite-step opacity, and ask whether the intruder is not able to decide, at any time instant, when respectively whether the system was in a secret state during the last k observable steps. We design a new algorithm verifying weak k-step opacity, the complexity of which is lower than the complexity of existing algorithms and does not depend on the parameter k, and show how to use it to verify strong k-step opacity by reducing strong k-step opacity to weak k-step opacity.

In discrete-event systems, based on a standard setting in which an intruder has the complete knowledge of the system’s structure, the standard versions of current-state opacity and initial-state opacity cannot perfectly characterize higher-level privacy requirements. To overcome such a limitation, in this paper we propose two stronger versions of opacity called strong current-state opacity and strong initial-state opacity for partially-observed nondeterministic finite-state automata. Strong current-state (resp., initial-state) opacity describes that for each run of a system ending (resp., starting) at a secret state, there exists a non-secret run whose observation is the same as that of the previous run. Then we propose an information structure using a novel concurrent-composition technique to verify strong current-state opacity and strong initial-state opacity, which has time complexity O((|Σ||X|2+|Σo||X∖XS|2(1+|Σuo|))2|X∖XS|), where |X| (resp., |Σ|, |Σo|, |Σuo|, |X∖XS|) is the number of states (resp., events, observable events, unobservable events, non-secret states) of an automaton. Finally, the proposed information structure is also used to check strong infinite-step opacity, which has lower time complexity than the previous one in the literature.}

We consider several different types of optimization objectives, such as (1) minimization of attack energy cost, and (2) minimization of time cost to cause damage infliction; for the latter one, asynchronous event firings and concurrent event firings at the plant are both considered. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal attacker for both the energy minimization case and damage infliction time minimization case. Thus, this work may potentially provide a unified approach for the optimal synthesis of covert sensor–actuator attackers in different setups.}

In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message. A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property. We also present a method to create an encryption function to ensure confidentiality for a CPS, if it exists, when the secret language is formed only of sequences with length bounded by a given number.}

abstract = {Cybersecurity of discrete event systems (DES) has been gaining more and more attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems. One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks. We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand–supply relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are regular, it is possible to remove all such risky pairs from the plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks. The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far has not been achieved in the literature.}
