abstract="This paper focuses on the problem of cyber-attacks for discrete event systems under supervisory control. In more detail, the goal of the supervisor, who has a partial observation of the system evolution, is that of preventing the system from reaching a set of unsafe states. An attacker may act in two different ways: he can corrupt the observation of the supervisor editing the sensor readings, and can enable events that are disabled by the supervisor. This is done with the aim of leading the plant to an unsafe state, and keeping the supervisor unaware of that before the unsafe state is reached. A special automaton called attack structure is constructed as the parallel composition of two special structures. Such an automaton can be used by the attacker to select appropriate actions (if any) to reach the above goal, or equivalently by the supervisor, to validate its robustness with respect to such attacks.",

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate opacity of discrete event systems. We define two types of opacities: strong opacity and weak opacity. Given a general observation mapping, a language is strongly opaque if all strings in the language are confused with some strings in another language and it is weakly opaque if some strings in the language are confused with some strings in another language. We show that security and privacy of computer systems and communication protocols can be investigated in terms of opacity. In particular, two important properties in security and privacy, namely anonymity and secrecy, can be studied as special cases of opacity. We also show that by properly specifying the languages and the observation mapping, three important properties of discrete event systems, namely observability, diagnosability, and detectability, can all be reformulated as opacity. Thus, opacity has a wide range of applications. Also in this paper we provide algorithms for checking strong opacity and weak opacity for systems described by regular languages and having a generalized projection as the observation mapping.}
