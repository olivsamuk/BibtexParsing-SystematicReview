abstract = {Opacity is an important property asking whether a passive observer (an intruder), who knows the structure of the system but has only a limited observation of its behavior, may reveal the secret of the system. Several notions of opacity have been studied in the literature, including current-state opacity, k-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity. We investigate weak and strong k-step opacity, the notions that generalize both current-state opacity and infinite-step opacity, and ask whether the intruder is not able to decide, at any instant, when respectively whether the system was in a secret state during the last k observable steps. We design a new algorithm to verify weak k-step opacity, the complexity of which is lower than that of existing algorithms and that does not depend on the parameter k. Then, we show how to use this algorithm to verify strong k-step opacity by reducing the verification of strong k-step opacity to the verification of weak k-step opacity. The complexity of the resulting approach is again better than that of existing algorithms, and does not depend on the parameter k.}

An insertion function is a monitoring interface placed between the system and the outside observer that inserts fictitious events to the system output if necessary. To successfully enforce infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity, in this paper, we first review the insertion mechanism without considering the opacity enforcement issue, and propose two new automata for recognizing the safe languages for infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity respectively. Then, we enforce the infinite-step opacity and the K-step opacity with the reviewed insertion mechanism. Computational complexity issues are also discussed. Our results extend the prior results about the synthesis of insertion functions from the notion of current-state opacity to the notions of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity.}

In this paper, we consider that the CPS is abstracted as a Discrete-Event System (DES), and we consider cyber attacks where the intruder eavesdrops the communication channels from the system to an intended receiver (e.g. a supervisor or diagnoser) to detect the occurrence of a sequence in the secret behavior of the system. In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message. A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property. We also present a method to create an encryption function to ensure confidentiality for a CPS, if it exists, when the secret language is formed only of sequences with length bounded by a given number.}

abstract = {Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMSs) are designed to execute parallel processes simultaneously by using flexible resources (e.g. robots, re-configurable machines) alongside a supervisor allocating the resources to the different processes. In these systems, deadlocks are defined as blocking states where no resource allocation decision can be taken. They originate from resources characteristics (i.e. mutual exclusion condition, non-preemptive), processes interactions (i.e. shared resources, circular wait of resources) and an inappropriate sequence of allocation decisions. In modern FMSs, the use of open and interconnected control components for resource allocation control and productivity enhancement makes FMSs vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Hence, although FMSs are designed to deal with known natural deadlocks, new malicious ones can originate from sophisticated cyber-attacks. In this paper, malicious deadlocks are defined and contextualized regarding the existing literature on deadlocks management and on cyber-attacks targeting Discrete-Event Systems (DES). Then, a model representative of deadlock attacks is proposed based on the S3PR theory and DES attacks modeling. Finally, the deadlock attack model is simulated and new malicious deadlocks are exhibited and discussed.}

Roughly speaking, a system is said to be opaque if the intruder, which is modeled by a passive observer, can never determine the “secret” of the system for sure. Most of the existing notions of opacity consider secrets related to the actual behaviors of the system. In this paper, we consider a new type of secret related to the knowledge of the system user. Specifically, we assume that the system user also only has partial observation of the system and has to reason the actual behavior of the system. We say a system is high-order opaque if the intruder can never determine that the system user knows some information of importance based on its own incomparable information. We provide the formal definition of high-order opacity. Two algorithms are provided for the verification of this new notion: one with doubly-exponential complexity for the worst case and the other with single-exponential complexity. Illustrative examples are provided for the new notion of high-order opacity.}

abstract = {In the discrete event systems literature, the studies addressing opacity usually assume a passive intruder, who has full knowledge of the structure of a system but with only a partial observation ability. This work touches upon the opacity problem in discrete event systems modeled with labeled Petri nets, by assuming the existence of an active intruder. Herein, an active intruder, whose abilities exceed passive observations, is assumed to be able to manipulate the behavior of a system through sensor attacks in a practical manner, i.e., in an embedded way, in order to compromise the opacity of a system. In this setting, a framework for opacity verification is first proposed from the intruder’s viewpoint, where opacity is referred to as “language-based opacity”. A verification algorithm is then derived to identify opaque secret words. Two stealthy attack models named sensor-failure-making strategy and sensor-injection-making strategy are introduced, allowing the intruder to implant/damage some sensors, i.e., add/delete some events, in line with the original behavior of a system, in order to infer the secret information. An algorithmic procedure for attractability analysis is provided for each attack strategy. Once a system is proved to be attackable, a stealthy attack structure that synthesizes different sensor-failure-making (resp. sensor-injection-making) attacks is constructed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed approaches by implementing the presented algorithms and running experiments on a manufacturing system example.}

The general purpose for multi-agent coordination is to synthesize a plan such that the LTL task is achieved optimally. In addition to the standard requirement on the correctness of the plan, we further investigate the potential information leakage of each agent during the operating process. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the behavior of each individual agent is partially monitored by a passive intruder modeled as an outside observer or an eavesdropper. The security constraint requires that the intruder can never identify for sure that some specific individual agent is carrying out some sub-tasks of significant importance. To this end, we model the mobile capability of the agent team by a global labeled transition system. To describe information-flow security constraint, motivated by the generic notion of opacity, two different types security requirements are proposed for each individual agent. An effective coordination algorithm is proposed that synthesizes an optimal global plan for the entire agent team such that the global LTL task can be achieved, while the security of each individual agent is preserved. The proposed framework is implemented in real-world experiment and is also demonstrated by several case studies.}

If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net.

This is done with the aim of leading the plant to an unsafe state.

Such an automaton can be used by the attacker to select proper actions (if any) to lead the plant to reach the unsafe state.}

In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous “hold on” events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations.}

In this context, we formulate the problem of synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large class of edit attacks on the sensor readings and actuator commands. Intuitively, we search for a supervisor that guarantees the safety of the system even when sensor readings and actuator commands are compromised. Given the similarities of the investigated problem to the standard supervisory control problem, our solution methodology reduces the problem of synthesizing a robust supervisor against deception attacks to a supervisory control problem.
