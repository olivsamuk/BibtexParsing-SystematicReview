abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">The development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has brought much attention of researchers to cyber-attack and cyber-security. A sensor attacker targeting on a supervised discrete event system can modify a set of sensor readings and cause the closed-loop system to reach undesirable states. In this letter, we propose a new attack detection mechanism under which the supervisor only needs to keep track of the last observable event received. Given a plant and a supervisor enforcing a state specification, we define a sensor attacker threatening if it may cause the closed-loop system to enter a forbidden state. Our goal is to verify whether there exists such a threatening sensor attacker for a given controlled system. A new structure, called All Sensor Attack (ASA), is proposed to capture all possible sensor attacks launched by the attacker. Based on the ASA automaton, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a stealthy threatening sensor attacker is presented. Finally, we show that the condition can be verified in polynomial time.<br/></div> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">With the continuous development of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as their applications in the industrial environment, industrial internet comes into being. In comparison to the relatively closed and secure production environment of traditional industries, the industrial internet faces significant security challenges in terms of data privacy. This paper investigates the privacy-preserving control problem for data opacity of the industrial internet to provide a resilient defending strategy against cyber threats, where the system to be controlled is modeled as a networked discrete-event system (DES) and malicious eavesdroppers exist to infer the system secret based on its observations. We here aim at designing a networked supervisor to achieve the following two objectives: (1) eavesdroppers cannot infer the system secret based on its observations, which is formulated as the requirement of opacity enforcement, (2) under the control of the designed networked supervisor, the system could still achieve the predetermined control requirement. To solve the previously mentioned privacy-preserving supervisory control problem, this paper first proposes a privacy-preserving control architecture for networked DES, in which each component is modeled as a finite-state automaton to simulate its dynamics. We design an algorithm based on the constructed models to synthesize the networked supervisor by transforming the original privacy-preserving control problem into a classical Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control problem. Furthermore, this paper proves (1) the designed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and (2) the existence of the supremal networked supervisor for this privacy-preserving supervisory control problem.<br/></div> &copy; 2022, Science Press.

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">In this article, we study the security of control systems in the context of the supervisory control layer of stochastic discrete-event systems. Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the controller. In this article, we consider that such communication is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state. We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function, i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple objectives. Our solution methodology is based on mapping these problems to optimal control problems for Markov decision processes, specifically, a probabilistic reachability problem and a stochastic shortest path problem.<br/></div> &copy; 1963-2012 IEEE.},

A discrete event system is current-state opaque if an intruder is never able to verify whether the current state of the system is within the secret states. This article addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable transitions and propose an approach for the verification of current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets. It is shown by experimental studies that the symbolic approach is practically more efficient than traditional techniques such as basis reachability graphs (BRGs).<br/></div> IEEE},

Given a discrete event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph, new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity. The proposed approaches are shown to be more efficient than the standard methods based on the reachability graph.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

A labeled finite-state automaton (LFSA) can be seen as such a monitor and the control properties in LFSAs have been widely studied, where detectability is one of the fundamental inference-based control properties describing whether one could use output sequences to determine the current and subsequent states. In this paper, we study how an attacker affects strong detectability and weak detectability of an LFSA. We formulate an attacker as a K-memory attacker, which can remember and distort K-length output sequences generated by an LFSA. We give a systematic method to verify when this type of attackers affect detectability of an LFSA.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 American Automatic Control Council.},

For a complex system with multiple secret states, it is difficult to ensure the system opacity, which makes it necessary to actively control the system to enforce their opacity. In this regard, based on the framework of partially observable and controllable discrete event system, the active current-state opacity is studied. The system being actively opaque means that we can find a control for each secret state such that the behaviour of system reaching the secret state is opaque. Under such control, the intruder is unable to confirm the current state as secret state through limited observation. We construct an active-opacity verifier and derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check the active opacity of the system.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This work studies the verification problem of critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets. The proposed method is a two-fold process: a preliminary verification of critical observability for the underlying logic labeled Petri net and a further verification considering the time constraint associated with each transition. The first step is based on the concurrent composition of a reachability graph of the logic net. If the logic net is critically observable, then the time net is also critically observable at any given time instant. Otherwise, the second step is to design an algorithm to compute all pairs of transition-class sequences that violate critical observability at the given time instant, and then a set of linear programming problems is exploited to check critical observability for the corresponding timed system. &lt;italic&gt;Note to Practitioners&lt;/italic&gt;&#x2014;Timed discrete event systems provide a theoretical model for safety-critical real applications such as air traffic management, smart grid, and industrial control, which are vulnerable to malicious attack and destruction at some particular time instants such that a system may be misled to dangerous states. Critical observability of a timed discrete event system is a property with which the predefined dangerous states can be determined and detected from the observation by an observer at a given time instant. This research aims to offer a systematic approach to check critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets, which can also present some new ideas and insights for practitioners in the field of safety-critical systems.<br/></div> IEEE},

This article deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners - Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state, recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs), introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).<br/></div> &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.},
