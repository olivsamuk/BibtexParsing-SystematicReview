Various approaches have been proposed for FDD like Analytical redundancy x0028 AR x0029, Principal component analysis x0028 PCA x0029, Discrete event system x0028 DES x0029 model etc., in the literature. Performance of FDD schemes greatly depends on accuracy of the sensors which measure the system parameters. Due to various reasons like faults, communication errors etc., sensors may occasionally miss or report erroneous values of some system parameters to FDD engine, resulting in measurement inconsistency of these parameters. Schemes like AR, PCA etc., have mechanisms to handle measurement inconsistency, however, they are computationally heavy. DES based FDD techniques are widely used because of computational simplicity, but they cannot handle measurement inconsistency efficiently. Existing DES based schemes do not use Measurement inconsistent x0028 MI x0029 parameters for FDD. These parameters are not permanently unmeasurable or erroneous, so ignoring them may lead to weak diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a Measurement inconsistent discrete event system x0028 MIDES x0029 framework, which uses MI parameters for FDD at the instances they are measured by the sensors. Otherwise, when they are unmeasurable or erroneously reported, the MIDES invokes an estimator diagnoser that predicts the statex0028 s x0029 the system is expected to be in, using the subsequent parameters measured by the other sensors. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated using a pump-valve system. In addition, an MIDES based intrusion detection system has been developed for detection of rogue dynamic host configuration protocol x0028 DHCPx0029 server attack by mapping the attack to a fault in the DES framework.<br/></div> &copy; 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

Previous work focuses on whether unsafe behaviour can be prevented using supervisory control theory. When unsafe behaviour cannot be prevented with certainty, mitigation strategies are limited. This paper proposes the use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack models presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The least-unsafe (LU) supervisor problem is introduced to minimize this unsafe likelihood measure and improve existing attack mitigation techniques. The LU supervisor problem under full observability is solved by reformulating it into an MDP problem, and a computable algorithm is developed.

abstract = {Rogue Twin Access Point (AP) is a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot/AP setup by an adversary solely with the purpose of luring Wi-Fi stations (STAs) into connecting to them. An adversary clones the Service Set IDentifier (SSID) [Hotspot Name] as well as the MAC address of the legitimate AP while setting up the rogue twin. When a STA checks for the list of available APs (under presence of rogue twin), it sees only one AP (despite there being two APs with the identical SSID and MAC address). In case the signal strength of the rogue twin is more than the legitimate AP, the STA connects to the rogue twin.In the present study, a Discrete Event System (DES) paradigm based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting rogue twin which is proposed. It overcomes many drawbacks of existing approaches in tackling rogue twin. A normal DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under normal network conditions along with a failure (attacker) DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under rogue twin network conditions is constructed. Using the knowledge of the normal and attacker DES models, a DES diagnoser is constructed to ascertain whether the frame exchange corresponds to a normal or attack condition. Even if an attacker uses multiple techniques to launch the rogue twin the proposed DES based IDS is capable of identifying all such possible instances. We validate the scheme on a real test bed.<br/> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame (s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA (s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame (s) to retrieve the buffered frame (s) of the sleeping STA (s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA (s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios.<br/></div> &copy; 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract = {6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6 connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the butter, which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic solutions and split butter approaches to intelligently guarantee butter reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before. We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared to the state of the art solutions.<br/> &copy; 2020 IEEE.},

abstract = {Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.<br/> &copy; 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">&mdash; Opacity is a security property formalizing the information leakage of a system to an external observer, namely intruder. The conventional opacity that has been studied in the Discrete Event System (DES) literature usually assumes passive intruders, who only observe the behavior of the system. However, in many cybersecurity concerns, such as web service, active intruders, who are capable of influencing the system&rsquo;s behavior beyond passive observations, need to be considered and defended against. We are therefore motivated to extend the opacity notions to handle active intruders. For this, we model the system as a non-deterministic finite-state transducer. It is assumed that the intruder has a full knowledge of the system structure and is capable of interacting with the system by injecting different inputs and observing its responses. In this setup, we first introduce reactive current-state opacity (RCSO) notion characterizing a property that the system does not leak its secret state regardless of how the intruder manipulates the system behavior. We furthermore extend this notion to language-based and initial-state reactive opacity notions, and study the relationship among them. It turns out that all the proposed reactive opacity notions are equivalent to RCSO. We therefore focus on RCSO and study its verification problem. It is shown that the RCSO can be verified by constructing an observer automaton. Illustrative examples are provided throughout the paper to demonstrate the key definition and the effectiveness of the proposed opacity verification approach.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020, The Authors.

The main motives for the interest to ICS is the ease for performing cyberattacks and the potential damages inflicted to the system and its environment in case of success. The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for detecting malicious orders in discrete-event system. Four types of attacks (direct, sequential, temporal and over-soliciting) that affect an industrial system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the "automation-knowledge". Thus, by using models of system with an improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent. Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on simulation examples and an industrial platform.

Much of the proposed on-line testing techniques are for synchronous circuits as compared to asynchronous circuits. The existing online testing(OLT) techniques of asynchronous circuits involve development of checkers that verify the correctness of the predefined protocol. The area overhead of this type of checkers is quit high because of Mutex blocks, which are the main component of the checker. In this paper, we have adapted the theory of Failure Detection and Diagnosis(FDD) available in the literature on Timed Discrete Event Systems(TDES) to on-line testing of asynchronous circuits. The proposed scheme includes modeling the behavior of the circuit under normal and various stuck at fault conditions and eventually, an on-chip detector circuit is designed. The detector monitors the circuit on-line and determines whether the circuit is functioning in normal or failure mode. The main advantages of this scheme are non-intrusiveness and low area overheads compared to similar schemes reported in the literature.<br/> &copy; 2015 IEEE.},

In this monograph we consider two possible sources of major disruptions, i.e., component faults and cyber intrusions. A component fault is an indigenous activity that renders unavailability or inaccessibility of certain functions within a component, either permanently or temporarily. It typically generates safety and performance concerns. Cyber intrusion on the other hand is an exogenous activity that tampers privacy, confidentiality, availability, or integrity of the system. These two sources are not always independent from each other. For example, a cyber intrusion may trigger a component fault, whereas a component fault may open a door for cyber intrusion, e.g., by keeping it undetected. For cyber intrusion, we will focus on opacity, which describes the system's ability to hide certain secrets from an external observer (or eavesdropper), and sensor and actuator attacks that exploit the system's existing controller to generate undesirable behaviours. In this monograph, we provide a detailed account of most recent research outcomes on fault diagnosis, opacity analysis and enhancement, and cyber security analysis and enforcement, within suitable discrete event system modelling frame-works. In each case, we describe basic problem statements and key concepts, and then point out the key challenges in each research area. After that, we present a thorough review of state-of-the-art techniques, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

In this paper we focus on Minimal De-authentication (de-auth henceforth) DoS Attack which is a low rate de-auth DoS attack in Wi-Fi networks. There exist studies which can tackle flooding based de-auth DoS, however, there has been limited work done in the case for minimal de-auth DoS attack. The network frame exchange under minimal de-auth DoS attack and normal de-auth process is the same, making the detection even more challenging. Since minimal de-auth DoS attack involves sending only a few spoofed de-auth frames into the network, no significant frame injection can be observed in the network. So the contemporary signature and anomaly based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) fail to recognize the minimal de-auth DoS attack. In this paper, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based IDS for detecting minimal de-auth DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS provides a novel detection method and does not require any protocol changes, or require any server/client side changes and can be proved for completeness and correctness. Experiments results show that the proposed DES based IDS detects minimal de-auth DoS attack swiftly and with high accuracy.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 IEEE.},

In comparison to the relatively closed and secure production environment of traditional industries, the industrial internet faces significant security challenges in terms of data privacy. This paper investigates the privacy-preserving control problem for data opacity of the industrial internet to provide a resilient defending strategy against cyber threats, where the system to be controlled is modeled as a networked discrete-event system (DES) and malicious eavesdroppers exist to infer the system secret based on its observations. We here aim at designing a networked supervisor to achieve the following two objectives: (1) eavesdroppers cannot infer the system secret based on its observations, which is formulated as the requirement of opacity enforcement, (2) under the control of the designed networked supervisor, the system could still achieve the predetermined control requirement. To solve the previously mentioned privacy-preserving supervisory control problem, this paper first proposes a privacy-preserving control architecture for networked DES, in which each component is modeled as a finite-state automaton to simulate its dynamics. We design an algorithm based on the constructed models to synthesize the networked supervisor by transforming the original privacy-preserving control problem into a classical Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control problem. Furthermore, this paper proves (1) the designed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and (2) the existence of the supremal networked supervisor for this privacy-preserving supervisory control problem.<br/></div> &copy; 2022, Science Press.

In this paper, we consider that the CPS is abstracted as a Discrete-Event System (DES), and we consider cyber attacks where the intruder eavesdrops the communication channels from the system to an intended receiver (e.g. a supervisor or diagnoser) to detect the occurrence of a sequence in the secret behavior of the system. In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message. A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property. We also present a method to create an encryption function to ensure confidentiality for a CPS, if it exists, when the secret language is formed only of sequences with length bounded by a given number.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the controller. In this article, we consider that such communication is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state. We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function, i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple objectives. Our solution methodology is based on mapping these problems to optimal control problems for Markov decision processes, specifically, a probabilistic reachability problem and a stochastic shortest path problem.<br/></div> &copy; 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The solution methodology proposed in this work is to solve the covert sensor attack synthesis problem for networked DES by modeling it as the well studied Ramadge-Wonham supervisor synthesis problem, and the constructions work for both the damage-reachable attacks and the damage-nonblocking attacks.

The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment.<br/></div> &copy; 2017},

However, they are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack, the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin attacks in a Wi-Fi network.<br/> &copy; 2019 IEEE.},

It then follows that it is possible to use the many techniques and tools already developed for solving the supervisor synthesis problem to solve the covert actuator attacker synthesis problem for free. In particular, we show that, if the attacker cannot attack unobservable events to the supervisor, then the reductions can be carried out in polynomial time. We also provide a brief discussion on some other conditions under which the exponential blowup in state size can be avoided.

The steep rise in extensive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, of late, makes it necessary for web services to be used over the internet by constrained wireless nodes for a majority of Machine-To-Machine (M2M) applications. However, considering that the system is constrained, ensuring security is a challenge when employing CoAP since it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is unrealiable and lacks handshaking mechanism. A malicious endpoint with read and write access can severly jeopardize service availability by launching an IP address spoofed attack. Moreover, it can help mount other complex Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks like amplification attacks. Though response spoofing vulnerability has been addressed in the research community for quite some time now, request spoofing countermeasures are relatively few. In this paper, we propose an attacker identification scheme using a Discrete Event System (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Through our scheme, we not only detect request and response spoofing attack in CoAP, but also identify the adversarial node by analysing the LoWPAN event dynamics generated due to probe responses. Correctness of our approach is guaranteed by construction of a DES diagnoser. We have tested our approach on Contiki OS. The experimental results show our proposed scheme to be energy efficient with response time of approx 6 sec at 99.2% accuracy.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 IEEE.},

A discrete event system is current-state opaque if an intruder is never able to verify whether the current state of the system is within the secret states. This article addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable transitions and propose an approach for the verification of current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets. It is shown by experimental studies that the symbolic approach is practically more efficient than traditional techniques such as basis reachability graphs (BRGs).<br/></div> &copy; 2013 IEEE.},

Given a discrete event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph, new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity.

The supervisor&rsquo;s goal is to enforce a specific language in spite of the opponent&rsquo;s actions and without knowing which adversary it is playing against. This problem is motivated by applications to computer security in which a cyber defense system must make decisions based on reports from sensors that may have been tampered with by an attacker. We start by showing that the problem has a solution if and only if the desired language is controllable (in the Discrete event system classical sense) and observable in a (novel) sense that takes the adversaries into account. For the particular case of attacks that insert symbols into or remove symbols from the sequence of sensor outputs, we show that testing the existence of a supervisor and building the supervisor can be done using tools developed for the classical DES supervisory control problem, by considering a family of automata with modified output maps, but without expanding the size of the state space and without incurring on exponential complexity on the number of attacks considered.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2017, The Authors.

For a complex system with multiple secret states, it is difficult to ensure the system opacity, which makes it necessary to actively control the system to enforce their opacity. In this regard, based on the framework of partially observable and controllable discrete event system, the active current-state opacity is studied. The system being actively opaque means that we can find a control for each secret state such that the behaviour of system reaching the secret state is opaque. Under such control, the intruder is unable to confirm the current state as secret state through limited observation.

We adopt a discrete event system (DES) approach, where information received from sensors and actions realized by actuators are represented as discrete events. We first develop a model of the attacked system using supervisory control of DES.

abstract = {Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for determining the link layer or Medium Access Control (MAC) address of a network host, given its Internet Layer (IP) or Network Layer address. ARP is a stateless protocol and any IPMAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IPMAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IPMAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IPMAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IPMAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IPMAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed. &copy; 2010 ISA.

abstract = {Initial-state estimation consists in determining the initial state of the system based on the observation from the system and the system structure. It is the basis for many problems in security applications, such as opacity, detectability and supervisory control. However, when it comes to cyber-physical systems (CPS) communication delays and losses are inevitable. In this letter, we study the initial-state estimation problem in a CPS that is modeled with a multi-channel networked discrete event system (NDES). In practice, the system is usually distributed over several locations, and the communication between the system and an agent (e.g., intruder, observer, supervisor) is carried out via a shared network, in which communication delays and losses may happen. In multi-channel NDESs, even when the first-in first-out rule is satisfied in each channel, the order of events received by the agent may still be shuffled due to random communication delays in each channel. To address these new challenges, we formalize the initial-state estimation problem in multi-channel NDESs and a networked initial-state estimator is proposed to generate the exact initial-state estimate.<br/> &copy; 2017 IEEE.},

Based on which, we convert this parameter and insertion function co-synthesis problem into a nonlinear program.

Various notions of opacity have received significant attention during the last decade including current state opacity and initial state opacity, which have been studied for deterministic and probabilistic systems in untimed contexts. In timed systems, opacity requirements may vary with time and one could also be interested in knowing the time duration for which opacity requirements are violated or preserved. The main contribution of this article is to introduce and analyze opacity exposure and opacity revelation times as measures of vulnerability in timed discrete event system (DES) that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., at any given time, all enabled events are independent and distributed in time with exponential probability density functions). Labeled stochastic Petri nets (LSPNs) are used to model timed stochastic DESs, and appropriate constructions (involving current and initial state observers) are used to evaluate exposure and revelation times for a given LSPN.<br/></div> &copy; 1963-2012 IEEE.},

Enforcing opacity in a discrete-event system, encoded by a finite labelled transition system (LTS), is a way to avoid information leakage. Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for constructing local controllers that enforces opacity for each secret separately.<br/></div> Copyright &copy; 2020 The Authors.},

This stringent requirement of DES diagnosability condition renders many systems non-diagnosable. I-diagnosability framework provides a weaker notion of diagnosability than DES diagnosability by considering only those failures that are followed by certain observable event(s) known as indicator events. However, some systems are I-non-diagnosable even in the presence of an indicator event following the failure event. In this paper, we propose I<sup>2</sup>-diagnosability framework overcomes the shortcomings of the I-diagnosability framework. In I<sup>2</sup>-DES framework an empowering event ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully. We have considered a practical example of Advanced Stealth Man in the Middle attack in Wi-Fi networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed I<sup>2</sup>-DES framework wherein the I-DES framework fails.<br/> &copy; 2015 IEEE.},

The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker, assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and results in a "local"symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e., only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a certain total cost.<br/></div> &copy; 2021 EUCA.},

This work studies the verification problem of critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets. The proposed method is a two-fold process: a preliminary verification of critical observability for the underlying logic labeled Petri net and a further verification considering the time constraint associated with each transition. The first step is based on the concurrent composition of a reachability graph of the logic net. If the logic net is critically observable, then the time net is also critically observable at any given time instant. Otherwise, the second step is to design an algorithm to compute all pairs of transition-class sequences that violate critical observability at the given time instant, and then a set of linear programming problems is exploited to check critical observability for the corresponding timed system. &lt;italic&gt;Note to Practitioners&lt;/italic&gt;&#x2014;Timed discrete event systems provide a theoretical model for safety-critical real applications such as air traffic management, smart grid, and industrial control, which are vulnerable to malicious attack and destruction at some particular time instants such that a system may be misled to dangerous states.

This research aims to offer a systematic approach to check critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets, which can also present some new ideas and insights for practitioners in the field of safety-critical systems.<br/></div> IEEE},

abstract = {The various fields of application for miniature air vehicles often do not provide distinct landing areas or even require additional equipment like nets or parachutes to land the aircraft without damaging it. This work introduces the deep stall landing (DSL) as a maneuver that uses the extraordinary aerodynamic characteristics of a delta wing MAV that come into effect after the angle of attack passes the stall angle. This landing maneuver is modeled based on a longitudinal aerodynamic model that takes lift, drag, thrust, weight, and pitching moment into account. By determining the operational modes that the aircraft has to perform in order to either complete the landing maneuver or abort it in case of a missed approach a hybrid system is identified. This system contains both continuous and discrete state dynamics that model the aircraft in each landing phase. Based on this hybrid system reachability analyses are performed which utilize level set methods to calculate backwards reachable sets. These sets are used to identify transitions within the modeled system that bring the aircraft form one operational mode to another without leaving the safe flight envelope. The final result is a discrete event system that covers all possible transitions within the refined model. Based on this discrete model an autonomous system can be implemented that is able to determine whether the initiation of the landing maneuver is safe in terms of keeping the aircraft within the safe flight envelope during the whole maneuver. Furthermore the results of the reachability analysis determine for which states of the aircraft it would be safe to initiate a recovery maneuver in case of a missed landing approach. &copy; 2011 IEEE.<br/>},
