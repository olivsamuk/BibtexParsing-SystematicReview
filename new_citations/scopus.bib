abstract={In this article, we study the security of control systems in the context of the supervisory control layer of stochastic discrete-event systems. Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the controller. In this article, we consider that such communication is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state. We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function, i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple objectives. Our solution methodology is based on mapping these problems to optimal control problems for Markov decision processes, specifically, a probabilistic reachability problem and a stochastic shortest path problem. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Opacity is an important information-flow security property that characterizes the plausible deniability of a dynamic system for its “secret” against eavesdropping attacks. As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous “hold on” events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Opacity is an important information security property. Given a discrete event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph, new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity. The proposed approaches are shown to be more efficient than the standard methods based on the reachability graph. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

We investigate the synthesis problem of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity by using insertion function. An insertion function is a monitoring interface placed between the system and the outside observer that inserts fictitious events to the system output if necessary. To successfully enforce infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity, in this paper, we first review the insertion mechanism without considering the opacity enforcement issue, and propose two new automata for recognizing the safe languages for infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity respectively. Then, we enforce the infinite-step opacity and the K-step opacity with the reviewed insertion mechanism. Computational complexity issues are also discussed.

abstract={This paper investigates the coordination of multiple agents for high-level tasks described by linear temporal logics (LTL). The general purpose for multi-agent coordination is to synthesize a plan such that the LTL task is achieved optimally. In addition to the standard requirement on the correctness of the plan, we further investigate the potential information leakage of each agent during the operating process. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the behavior of each individual agent is partially monitored by a passive intruder modeled as an outside observer or an eavesdropper. The security constraint requires that the intruder can never identify for sure that some specific individual agent is carrying out some sub-tasks of significant importance. To this end, we model the mobile capability of the agent team by a global labeled transition system. To describe information-flow security constraint, motivated by the generic notion of opacity, two different types security requirements are proposed for each individual agent. An effective coordination algorithm is proposed that synthesizes an optimal global plan for the entire agent team such that the global LTL task can be achieved, while the security of each individual agent is preserved. The proposed framework is implemented in real-world experiment and is also demonstrated by several case studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

We present several methods for language-based opacity verification, and a general approach to transform state-based notions into language-based ones. We demonstrate this approach for current-state and initial-state opacity, unifying existing results. We then investigate the notions of K-step opacity. We provide a language-based view of K-step opacity encompassing two existing notions and two new ones. We then analyze the corresponding language-based verification methods both formally and with numerical examples.

abstract={Denial-of-Service (DoS) are attacks conducted by malicious agents that consists in disrupting, temporally or indefinitely, the services provided by a communication network. When a malicious agent gets access to some network node, it may also perform deception attacks by inserting valid packets with fake information into vulnerable channels. We address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete event systems (NDES). To this end, we propose an automaton model for NDES subject to DoS-D attacks that represents the adverse effects of DoS-D attacks on the observations of local diagnosers. We introduce a new codiagnosability definition called DoS-D-robust codiagnosability, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be DoS-D-robustly codiagnosable. We also propose a verification algorithm for regular languages to check DoS-D-robust codiagnosability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This work is set in the context of supervisory control of discrete-event systems under partial observation. Attackers that are able to insert or erase occurrences of particular output symbols can tamper with the supervisor’s observation and by doing so, can lead the controlled system to undesirable states. We consider a scenario with multiple attackers, each one being an element of a set, called the attack set. We also assume that only one of the attackers within an attack set is acting, although we don’t know which one. According to previous results in the literature, a supervisor that enforces a given legal language, regardless of which attacker is acting, can be designed if the legal language is controllable and satisfies a property called P-observability for an attack set. The latter is an extended notion of observability and is related with the supervisor’s ability to always distinguish between outputs that require different control actions, even if the outputs were attacked. We present a new approach for checking if a given language is P-observable for an attack set, by first introducing a visual representation as well as some definitions that capture the attack’s effect. Additionally, we present two algorithms that together allow us to verify if a given language is P-observable for an attack set, when it is represented as an automaton. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In particular, we assume that this is done by tampering with the sensor-readings in the sensor communication channel. Specifically, we use Petri nets as the reference formalism to model the plant and assume a control specification in terms of a generalized mutual exclusion constraint. We propose three different methods to derive a control policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems. On the contrary, the third method computes a policy more efficiently and reveals more easily implementable in practice. However, this is done at the expense of optimality. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Opacity is an important security notion for discrete event systems (DESs) to measure the secret behaviors leaked to an intruder. The intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs, called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={As an essential attribute of information flow, opacity is used to characterise whether or not the intruders can infer the system secrets, which has caused considerable concern. For a complex system with multiple secret states, it is difficult to ensure the system opacity, which makes it necessary to actively control the system to enforce their opacity. In this regard, based on the framework of partially observable and controllable discrete event system, the active current-state opacity is studied. The system being actively opaque means that we can find a control for each secret state such that the behaviour of system reaching the secret state is opaque. Under such control, the intruder is unable to confirm the current state as secret state through limited observation. We construct an active-opacity verifier and derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check the active opacity of the system. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

In this article, the decentralized fault prognosis of partially observed DESs is analyzed with a universal state-estimate-based protocol. It follows (M,K) as the performance bound of any expected decentralized prognosers, where any fault can be predicted K steps before its occurrence and the fault is guaranteed to occur within M steps once a corresponding fault alarm is issued. To determine whether expected decentralized prognosers exist, the notion of state-estimate-coprognosability (SE-coprognosability) under the case of one fault type is proposed. Compared with existing other kinds of coprognosability, SE-coprognosability is a more generalized concept. Meanwhile, combining the formal method and algebraic state space approach, a novel state estimation algorithm is presented and based on which, the verification of SE-coprognosability is also solved.

abstract={In this paper we study a resilient supervisory control design problem in discrete-event systems. Consider that there are certain unsafe states in the system that must be prevented from entering, and this can be ensured by a supervisor disabling certain controllable events. Also consider that the system is subject to actuator attacks from intruders: some controllable events disabled by a supervisor may be re-enabled by an intruder. Our purpose is to address a challenging scenario where the controllable events that are vulnerable to attacks are indefinite, i.e., any controllable event can be attacked. Associating to each unsafe state with a required safety level (a positive integer), our aim of this work is to design a resilient supervisor such that for every unsafe state q, if the number of actuator attacks is no greater than the safety level of q, then the controlled system is guaranteed to avoid entering q. We first encode the behavior of the system under attack into an automaton called the resiliency automaton. We then show that the resilient supervisor synthesis problem may be cast into a supervisory control problem in the resiliency automaton. Hence, a maximally permissive resilient supervisor can be obtained by using the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on supervisory control design against indefinite actuator attacks in discrete-event systems. IEEE},

abstract={Given a discrete event system, it is said to be opaque if an intruder who can partially observe system behavior cannot infer that the system is necessarily in a predefined secret. A discrete event system is current-state opaque if an intruder is never able to verify whether the current state of the system is within the secret states. This article addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable transitions and propose an approach for the verification of current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets. It is shown by experimental studies that the symbolic approach is practically more efficient than traditional techniques such as basis reachability graphs (BRGs). IEEE},

abstract={The development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has brought much attention of researchers to cyber-attack and cyber-security. A sensor attacker targeting on supervised discrete event system can modify a set of sensor readings and cause the closed-loop system to reach undesirable states. In this paper, we propose a new attack detection mechanism under which the supervisor only needs to keep track of the last observable event received. Given a plant and a supervisor enforcing a state specification, we define a sensor attacker threatening if it may cause the closed-loop system to enter a forbidden state. Our goal is to verify whether there exists such a threatening sensor attacker for a given controlled system. A new structure, called All Sensor Attack (ASA), is proposed to capture all possible sensor attacks launched by the attacker. Based on the ASA automaton, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a stealthy threatening sensor attacker is presented. Finally, we show that the condition can be verified in polynomial time. IEEE},

abstract={In this work, we address the problem of synthesis of covert attackers in the setup where the model of the plant is available, but the model of the supervisor is unknown, to the adversary. To compensate the lack of knowledge on the supervisor, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem. The heuristic algorithm developed in this paper may allow the adversary to synthesize covert attackers without having to know the model of the supervisor, which could be hard to obtain in practice. For simplicity, we shall only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks.

abstract={This work deals with the language-based opacity verification and enforcement problems in discrete event systems modeled with labeled Petri nets. Opacity is a security property that relates to privacy protection by hiding secret information of a system from an external observer called an “intruder”. A secret can be a subset of a system's language. In this case, opacity is referred to as language-based opacity. A system is said to be language-based opaque if an intruder, with a partial observation on the system's behavior, cannot deduce whether the sequences of events corresponding to the generated observations are included in the secret language or not. We propose a novel and efficient approach for language-based opacity verification and enforcement, using the concepts of basis markings and basis partition. First, a sufficient condition is formulated to check language-based opacity for labeled Petri nets by solving an integer-programming problem. A unique graph, called a modified basis reachability graph (MBRG), is then derived to verify different language-based opacity properties. The proposed method relaxes the acyclicity assumption of the unobservable transition subnet thanks to the basis partition notion. A new embedded insertion function technique is also provided to deal with opacity enforcement. This technique ensures that no new observed behavior is created. A verification algorithm is developed to check the enforceability of a system. Finally, once a system is proved to be enforceable, an algorithm is given to construct a new structure, called an insertion automaton, which synthesizes all possible insertion functions that ensure opacity. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={With the continuous development of information and communication technologies (ICT) as well as their applications in the industrial environment, industrial internet comes into being. In comparison to the relatively closed and secure production environment of traditional industries, the industrial internet faces significant security challenges in terms of data privacy. This paper investigates the privacy-preserving control problem for data opacity of the industrial internet to provide a resilient defending strategy against cyber threats, where the system to be controlled is modeled as a networked discrete-event system (DES) and malicious eavesdroppers exist to infer the system secret based on its observations. We here aim at designing a networked supervisor to achieve the following two objectives: (1) eavesdroppers cannot infer the system secret based on its observations, which is formulated as the requirement of opacity enforcement, (2) under the control of the designed networked supervisor, the system could still achieve the predetermined control requirement. To solve the previously mentioned privacy-preserving supervisory control problem, this paper first proposes a privacy-preserving control architecture for networked DES, in which each component is modeled as a finite-state automaton to simulate its dynamics. We design an algorithm based on the constructed models to synthesize the networked supervisor by transforming the original privacy-preserving control problem into a classical Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control problem. Furthermore, this paper proves (1) the designed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and (2) the existence of the supremal networked supervisor for this privacy-preserving supervisory control problem. © 2022, Science Press.

We formulate the opacity property as a safety one over an appropriately constructed augmented system, and aim to verify this latter property by finding suitable barrier certificates. To reduce the computational complexity associated with computing barrier certificates for large networks, we propose a compositional approach to construct such barrier certificates for large-scale interconnected systems. This is achieved by introducing local barrier certificates for subsystems in the network and imposing some small-gain type conditions on the gains of those local barrier certificates. We also provide sufficient conditions for verifying the lack of opacity in large-scale networks by constructing barrier certificates ensuring some reachability properties over the augmented systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of our results, we consider the problem of tracking a target using a team of vehicles and verify if its initial position is secret from possible outside intruders. © 2017 IEEE.},

The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners - Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state, recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs), introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs). © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we study a cybersecurity problem of protecting system's secrets with multiple protections and a required security level, while minimizing the associated cost due to implementation/maintenance of these protections as well as the affected system usability. The target system is modeled as a discrete-event system (DES) in which there are a subset of marker states denoting the services/functions provided to regular users, a subset of secret states, and multiple subsets of protectable events with different security levels. We first introduce usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable events with at least a certain security level, and the highest usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES. Moreover, we extend the problem to the case of heterogeneous secrets with different levels of importance, and develop an algorithm to solve this extended problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions with a network security example. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Opacity is a security notion that focuses on determining whether a given system's behavior is kept secret to intruders. Various notions of opacity have received significant attention during the last decade including current state opacity and initial state opacity, which have been studied for deterministic and probabilistic systems in untimed contexts. In timed systems, opacity requirements may vary with time and one could also be interested in knowing the time duration for which opacity requirements are violated or preserved. The main contribution of this article is to introduce and analyze opacity exposure and opacity revelation times as measures of vulnerability in timed discrete event system (DES) that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., at any given time, all enabled events are independent and distributed in time with exponential probability density functions). Labeled stochastic Petri nets (LSPNs) are used to model timed stochastic DESs, and appropriate constructions (involving current and initial state observers) are used to evaluate exposure and revelation times for a given LSPN. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the verification and enforcement problems of strong infinite-step opacity and k-step opacity for partially observed discrete-event systems modeled by finite state automata. Strong infinite-step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred by an intruder at any instance along the entire observation trajectory, while strong k-step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred within k steps after the visit. We propose two information structures called an ∞-step recognizer and a k-step recognizer to verify these two properties. The complexities of our algorithms to verify strong infinite- and k-step opacity are O(22⋅|X|⋅|Eo|) and O(2(k+2)⋅|X|⋅|Eo|), respectively, which are lower than that of existing methods in the literature (|X| and |Eo| are the numbers of states and observable events in a plant, respectively). We also derive an upper bound for the value of k in strong k-step opacity, and propose an effective algorithm to determine the maximal value of k for a given plant. Finally, we note that enforcement of strong infinite- and k-step opacity can be transformed into a language specification enforcement problem and hence be solved using supervisory control. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Non-interference in discrete event systems deals with the possibility by an intruder to infer the occurrences of private and non observable events, the so called high-level ones, by interacting with the system at a user level, i.e., by observing the occurrence of the so called low-level ones. When bisimulation non-interference is considered, the security objective is not only to avoid the detection of high-level event occurrences, but also to avoid the detection of their non occurrences; i.e., the secret includes also the non occurrences of some events. This letter deals with such a more restrictive security property in the framework of discrete event systems modelled as Petri nets. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to assess bisimulation non-interference in bounded Petri nets. Such a condition requires the solution of integer linear programming optimization problems, whose solution can be used also to statically enforce bisimulation non-interference when this condition is not satisfied by the original system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Opacity, as an important security property, has been well investigated in crisp discrete event systems. However, in some practical systems, the general behaviors, secret and nonsecret behaviors obtained by the intruder need to be expressed as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets. Under this situation, the intruder makes inferences by fuzzy logic rather than classic logic, thus the notions of the fuzzy opacity measures are desired to be established. First, by means of the basic laws of fuzzy logic, a general fuzzy opacity measure, as a template, is presented, in this article, for the given generalized characterizations of secret and nonsecret behaviors. Moreover, a specific measure, called as fuzzy initial-final opacity (FIFO) measure, is investigated under the assumption that the secrets and nonsecrets can be coded into the initial-final state-pairs. In addition, two variants of FIFO measure are also proposed under the assumptions that the secrets and nonsecrets are only related to the initial-states or final-states. With these fuzzy opacity measures, the system designers can evaluate the opacity degree of the systems to be designed. To show the applicability of the fuzzy opacity measures to practical systems, we finally present an illustrative example of evaluating the location privacy protection systems in location-based services by means of the fuzzy opacity measures. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In many security applications, system behaviors must be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (intruders). Opacity was first studied for discrete event systems, and then it was extended to real-time systems. One of the challenges of real-time systems is the difficulty to guarantee their opacity against a potential attacker. In general, this property is undecidable for systems modeled by timed automata. A secret location, S, of a system is timed opaque to an intruder having partial observability of the system, if the intruder can never infer from the observation of any execution that the system has reached any secret location. In the present study, the static partial observability for systems modeled by nondeterministic timed automata is investigated. Thus, it focuses on systems where the timing of secret state reachability is bounded. The first contribution of this study is to define the bounded timed opacity property wherein, its complexity is proved. The second contribution is to consider systems where the secret should be kept hidden for a certain period referred to as the Δ-duration bounded opacity property. Also, a formal definition is proposed and its complexity is proved. In addition, the proposed properties are verified using timed bounded model checking. A case study ”Exchange in the Cloud system” is modeled by timed automaton to verify the proposed properties using SpaceEx tool. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Intuitively, the covertness property says that the attacker cannot reach a situation where its existence has been detected by the supervisor while no damage can be caused. We consider covert attackers that can exercise both actuator attacks (including enablement attacks and disablement attacks) and sensor attacks (restricted to sensor replacement attacks), where the (partial-observation) attackers may or may not eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We shall develop an exponential time reduction from the covert attacker synthesis problem to the well studied Ramadge–Wonham supervisor synthesis problem, which generalizes our previous work on a reduction based approach for covert actuator attacker synthesis, for both the damage-reachable goal and the damage-nonblocking goal. We also provide discussions on conditions under which the exponential blowup in state sizes, due to the reduction construction, can be avoided. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Resilience is a critical criterion to evaluate a networked system including discrete-event systems (DESs). This research touches upon the supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption. Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated through examples. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

We assume that a malicious intruder can increase the firing delay of transitions by adding delay in communication, or corrupt the transmitted data. Our target is to design a transition protecting policy to guarantee that the global performance does not drop below a given lower-bound threshold. Two classes of situations are considered: (1) the operator does not know the capability of the intruder, which means that all possible attacks must be taken into account; (2) the operator knows the upper bound of the capability of the intruder, e.g., the maximal number of transitions that can be simultaneously attacked. For the former case, we develop an algorithm using mixed integer linear programming to obtain an optimal protecting policy. For the latter situation, we develop a heuristic method to compute a protecting policy that is locally optimal. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents a backbone of modern reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), which enable manufacturing of a high product variety through rapid and easy reconfiguration of manufacturing equipment. In IIoT-enabled RMS, modular equipment is built from smart devices, each performing its own tasks, whereas the global functioning is achieved through their networking and intensive communication. Although device communication contributes to the system reconfigurability, it also opens up new security challenges due to potential vulnerability of communication links. In this article, we present security analysis for a major part of RMS in which manufacturing equipment is sequentially controlled and can be modeled as discrete event systems (DES). Control distribution within DES implies communication of certain events between smart modules. Specifically, in this work, we focus on attacks on communication of these events. In particular, we develop a method for modeling such attacks, including event insertion and removal attacks, in distributed sequential control; the method is based on the supervisory control theory framework. We show how the modeled attacks can be detected and provide a method for identification of communication links that require protection to avoid catastrophic damage of the system. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally validate applicability of our methodology on a real-world industrial case study with reconfigurable manufacturing equipment. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Opacity is an important information-flow property, which is used to characterize whether or not the secrets of system have been leaked to the intruders. Over the past ten years, opacity of discrete event systems (DESs) modeled as automata and Petri nets have been well investigated under the assumption that the communication channels between systems and intruders are perfect. However, in networked discrete event systems (NDESs), the DESs run in a shared network, and the communication delays and losses are inevitable usually. In this paper, we investigate the problems of opacity in the framework of NDESs. We formulate four kinds of opacity for NDESs, including current-state opacity, initial-state opacity, initial-final-state opacity, and K-step opacity. We also present the verification algorithms for these notions. We extend the notions of opacity in classical DESs, that is, if the communication delays and losses disappear, then these new notions would reduce to their classical counterparts. A number of examples are provided to illustrate the results obtained. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Recently, the problem of model-based synthesis of covert attackers has received a lot of attention in the discrete event systems literature. However, all the existing works assume the model of the supervisor to be available (to the adversary) for the synthesis to be effective, which can be unrealistic in practice. In this work, we consider a much more challenging, but more practical, setup where the model of the supervisor is in general not available. To compensate this lack of knowledge, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem over certain surrogate plant. Due to the over-approximation involved in the surrogate plant, the heuristic is provably sound, but in general it is not complete. For simplicity, in this paper we only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an IETF-standardized web transfer protocol, is specially designed to facilitate resource-constrained devices and low power, lossy networks. The steep rise in extensive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, of late, makes it necessary for web services to be used over the internet by constrained wireless nodes for a majority of Machine-To-Machine (M2M) applications. However, considering that the system is constrained, ensuring security is a challenge when employing CoAP since it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is unrealiable and lacks handshaking mechanism. A malicious endpoint with read and write access can severly jeopardize service availability by launching an IP address spoofed attack. Moreover, it can help mount other complex Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks like amplification attacks. Though response spoofing vulnerability has been addressed in the research community for quite some time now, request spoofing countermeasures are relatively few. In this paper, we propose an attacker identification scheme using a Discrete Event System (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Through our scheme, we not only detect request and response spoofing attack in CoAP, but also identify the adversarial node by analysing the LoWPAN event dynamics generated due to probe responses. Correctness of our approach is guaranteed by construction of a DES diagnoser. We have tested our approach on Contiki OS. The experimental results show our proposed scheme to be energy efficient with response time of approx 6 sec at 99.2% accuracy. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper deals with decentralized fault diagnosis for a discrete-event system that is observed at multiple observation sites through communication channels that can be attacked. The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker, assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and results in a "local"symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e., only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a certain total cost. © 2021 EUCA.},

abstract={When dealing with security and safety problems, Discrete Events Systems (DESs) could be a convenient way to model the behavior of distributed dynamical systems. Among the different DES mathematical tools, Petri Nets (PNs), by benefiting from a twofold representation, i.e. a graphical and a mathematical one, can be exploited for effectively tackling some security problems in the DES context such as the opacity one. This latter property is related to the capability of hiding a secret to external observers. When the secret is modeled by the initial marking (state) of a PN, the problem is known in literature as Initial-State Opacity (ISO). A DES is said to be ISO if, for every trajectory originating from a secret state, there exists another trajectory originated from a non-secret state, such that both of them are equivalent from an external observer (potentially malicious) point of view. Therefore, in an opaque system, such intruder can never determine whether the system started from a secret state or from a non-secret one. In this paper, leveraging the mathematical representation of PNs, we present a sufficient condition which permit to assess if a system is not opaque, by solving a feasibility problem with integer optimization variables. Specifically, the proposed approach starts from the ISO definition and, then, characterizes the aforementioned non-opacity condition as a set of linear constraints that, if not satisfied, imply the system to be not ISO. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

We assume that attackers can attack some sensors and actuators at the same time by altering observations and control commands. Because of the nondeterminism in observation and control caused by cyber attacks, the behavior of the supervised systems becomes nondeterministic and deviates from the target. We define two bounds on languages, an upper-bound and a lower-bound, to describe the nondeterministic behavior. We then use the upper-bound language to investigate the safety supervisory control problem under cyber attacks.

abstract={The problem of state estimation in the setting of partially-observed discrete event systems subject to cyber attacks is considered. An operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator. An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most $n$ events between two consecutive observations. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the enforcement of opacity via supervisory control in the context of discrete-event systems. A system is said to be opaque if the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never infer confidentially that the system is at a secret state. The design objective is to synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even when the control policy is publicly known. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enforcing opacity using non-deterministic supervisors. A non-deterministic supervisor is a decision mechanism that provides a set of control decisions at each instant, and randomly picks a specific control decision from the decision set to actually control the plant. Compared with the standard deterministic control mechanism, such a non-deterministic control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision is a random realization and cannot be implicitly inferred from the control policy. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for synthesizing a non-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. Furthermore, we show that non-deterministic supervisors IEEE},

abstract={Opacity is a property of information flow that characterizes the ability of a system to keep its secret information hidden from a third party called an attacker. In the state-of-the-art, opacity of Discrete Event Systems (DES) has been investigated using a variety of techniques. Methods based on Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) emerge as an efficient approach for enforcing this property. In this paper, we address the problem of enforcing the opacity of a DES through the definition of a supervisor whose role is to restrain the behavior of the system keeping “good” runs only i.e., executions that exactly correspond to the opaque subset of the system’s state space. The proposed approach is based on Symbolic Observation Graph: a hybrid graph where nodes are subsets of reachable states linked with unobservable actions. Encoding such nodes symbolically using binary decision diagrams allows to tackle the state space explosion problem. We designed a reduced-cost algorithm that synthesizes an optimal supervisor (at design time) to ensure the opacity of the system (at runtime). Moreover, we implemented our approach in C++ language and we validated our proposition using a real-life case study. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we propose an algorithm to verify this property.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate security and privacy issues in networked supervisory control systems over multiple channel networks. We consider a networked discrete-event system controlled by a supervisor that receives information from sensors and sends control decisions to actuators via observation channels and control channels, respectively. The security problem is studied for the scenario where some of the communication channels are insecure in the sense there exists a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that can access the information-flow in those insecure communication channels. We adopt the concept of opacity, an information flow security property, to characterize the security status of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that system has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder can never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the information-flow in the insecure channels. We consider the notions of current-state opacity, K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity in the networked control setting. New network observers are proposed to estimate the state of the system with two-side incomparable channel information. IEEE},

abstract={6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6 connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the butter, which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic solutions and split butter approaches to intelligently guarantee butter reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before. We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared to the state of the art solutions. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates attack mitigation problem in supervisory control of discrete event systems. We consider the scenario where the system is subject to actuator enablement attack. We explicitly distinguish between controllable events and defendable events; the former are events that can be disabled by the normal supervisor but may be subject to attack, while the latter are events that can be defensed (disabled definitely) by the mitigation module but possibly with higher costs. The objective is to design an attack mitigation strategy to prevent serious damage from attack. We formulate the attack mitigation problem as a tolerant control problem under partial observation. Particularly, in addition to guarantee safety, we aim to maximize the desirable behavior (normal specification) while minimize the tolerable behavior (safe but not desirable). We provide an effective online algorithm for solving this problem, which yields a novel attack mitigation strategy that generalizes the existing one in the literature. Specifically, we show that the proposed strategy may still prevent damage even when the safe-controllability condition, which is required by the existing strategy, does not hold. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we shall formulate and address a problem of covert actuator attacker synthesis for cyber-physical systems that are modeled by discrete-event systems. We assume the actuator attacker partially observes the execution of the closed-loop system and is able to modify each control command issued by the supervisor on a specified attackable subset of controllable events. We provide straightforward but in general exponential-time reductions, due to the use of subset construction procedure, from the covert actuator attacker synthesis problems to the Ramadge-Wonham supervisor synthesis problems. It then follows that it is possible to use the many techniques and tools already developed for solving the supervisor synthesis problem to solve the covert actuator attacker synthesis problem for free. In particular, we show that, if the attacker cannot attack unobservable events to the supervisor, then the reductions can be carried out in polynomial time. We also provide a brief discussion on some other conditions under which the exponential blowup in state size can be avoided. Finally, we show how the reduction based synthesis procedure can be extended for the synthesis of successful covert actuator attackers that also eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Opacity is a privacy property which aims to determine whether the “secret” of a system can be deduced by an outside intruder. In this paper, we investigate the enforcement of opacity using insertion functions which insert additional events if necessary to modify the output of the system. Inspired by the existing insertion mechanisms, we propose a mechanism named k-memory-embedded insertion mechanism for the enforcement of opacity. In our k-memory-embedded insertion mechanism, the insertion functions are determined based on the knowledge of system's exact states and the stored next sequence of events with length k. Especially, we define the property of ik-E-enforceability that a k-memory-embedded insertion function needs to satisfy for opacity enforcement, and further construct a verifier to determine whether a given opacity notion of the system is ik-E-enforceable or not. Our mechanism improves the embedded insertion mechanism by applying to a broader class of systems. Also, we improve the k-memory insertion mechanism by requiring a smaller number of consecutive events which need to be stored. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

It is the basis for many problems in security applications, such as opacity, detectability and supervisory control. However, when it comes to cyber-physical systems (CPS) communication delays and losses are inevitable. In this letter, we study the initial-state estimation problem in a CPS that is modeled with a multi-channel networked discrete event system (NDES). In practice, the system is usually distributed over several locations, and the communication between the system and an agent (e.g., intruder, observer, supervisor) is carried out via a shared network, in which communication delays and losses may happen. In multi-channel NDESs, even when the first-in first-out rule is satisfied in each channel, the order of events received by the agent may still be shuffled due to random communication delays in each channel. To address these new challenges, we formalize the initial-state estimation problem in multi-channel NDESs and a networked initial-state estimator is proposed to generate the exact initial-state estimate. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This article develops a novel compositional and abstraction-based approach to synthesize edit functions for opacity enforcement in modular discrete event systems. Edit functions alter the output of the system by erasing or inserting events in order to obfuscate the outside intruder, whose goal is to infer the secrets of the system from its observation. We synthesize edit functions to solve the opacity enforcement problem in a modular setting, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared with the monolithic approach. Two abstraction methods called opaque observation equivalence and opaque bisimulation are first employed to abstract the individual components of the modular system and their observers. Subsequently, we propose a method to transform the synthesis of edit functions to the calculation of modular supremal nonblocking supervisors. We show that the edit functions synthesized in this manner correctly solve the opacity enforcement problem. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of synthesizing maximally-permissive opacity-enforcing supervisors for partially-observed discrete-event systems. We focus on a specific type of opacity called infinite-step opacity requiring that the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never determine for sure that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific instant. When the original system is verified to be non-opaque, one is interested in synthesizing a supervisor that controls the system in a least-restrictive manner such that the closed-loop system is opaque. We provide an effective approach for solving the infinite-step opacity control problem by re-formulating this problem as a two-player game over a generalized information structure that involves information delays. We show that the proposed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and the resulting supervisor is maximally-permissive. Most of the existing works on opacity-enforcing supervisory control only consider current-state opacity in which no delayed information is involved. Our work provides a complete solution to the infinite-step opacity control problem without any assumption on the relationship between controllable events and observable events. © 2020 AACC.},

abstract={System opacity is a widely studied security notion, implying that a secret behaviour of a given system cannot be seen or assessed by an external observer based on the system evolution. This work deals with the problem of current-state opacity formulation and verification in the context of discrete event systems modelled with partially observed Petri nets (POPNs) (i.e., Petri nets containing place sensors that measure the number of tokens in observable places and event sensors that indicate the firing of observable transitions). A Petri net system is recognized as current-state opaque if the current-state estimate is never entirely contained in the set of secret states. In this regard, we introduce the notion of discernible markings to design a reduced state estimator called a discernible reachability graph, and then come up with formal modelling of current-state opacity in POPN systems. The main idea of the proposed approach consists in proving that if a system is current-state opaque, its current-state estimate, possibly established by an intruder, contains at least one non-secret state. We exploit the mathematical feasibility to formulate this concept by defining and solving an integer linear programming problem with respect to a given secret and an observation sequence collected from sensors. In the light of the proposed modelling, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for opacity verification, and examples are given to expose the results. © 2020},

abstract={We investigate the problem of synthesizing dynamic masks that preserve the infinite-step opacity in the context of discrete-event systems. Dynamic mask is an information acquisition mechanism that controls the observability of the system's events dynamically online, e.g., by turning sensors on/off. A system equipped with a dynamic mask is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all acquired information can never infer that the system was at some secret state for any specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem can only preserve the current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for the infinite-step opacity, which is stronger than the current-state opacity, is much more challenging. The main reason is that the delayed information is involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret can be revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture all the delayed information in the infinite-step opacity synthesis problem. An effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem, which extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from the current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity. Additionally, an information-state-reduction-based approach is proposed to further mitigate the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure. Finally, we discuss how to generalize our results to a class properties with delayed information including infinite-step K-anonymity and infinite-step indistinguishability. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Cybersecurity in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a crucial problem, as recent history has shown. A notable characteristic of ICS, compared to Information Technology, is the necessity to take into account the physical process, and its specific dynamics and effects on the environment, when considering cybersecurity issues. Intrusion Detection Systems have been studied extensively. In our work, we address the less classic topic of response mechanisms, and their automation in a self-protection feedback loop. More precisely, we address self-protection seen as resilience, where the functionality of the system is maintained under attacks, be it in a degraded mode. We model this as a Discrete Event Systems supervisory control problem, involving a model of the plant's possible behaviors, a model of considered attacks, and a formulation of the control objectives. We consider a case study, and perform a prototype implementation and simulation, using the Heptagon/BZR programming language and compiler/code generator, and targeting a multi-PLC experimental platform. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Cyber-attack models and their respective mitigation strategies have been recently studied in the discrete event systems setting. Previous work focuses on whether unsafe behaviour can be prevented using supervisory control theory. When unsafe behaviour cannot be prevented with certainty, mitigation strategies are limited. This paper proposes the use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack models presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The least-unsafe (LU) supervisor problem is introduced to minimize this unsafe likelihood measure and improve existing attack mitigation techniques. The LU supervisor problem under full observability is solved by reformulating it into an MDP problem, and a computable algorithm is developed. Lastly, the implementation of LU supervisors is discussed and illustrated with an example. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

The attacker can corrupt the sensor channels that transmit the sensor readings, making the operator incapable to establish when a critical marking is reached. We first construct the stealthy attack Petri net that keeps into account the real plant evolutions observed by the attacker and the corrupted plant evolutions observed by the operator. Starting from the reachability graph of the stealthy attack Petri net, an attack structure is defined: it describes all possible attacks. The supremal stealthy attack substructure can be obtained by appropriately trimming the attack structure. An attack function is effective if the supremal stealthy attack substructure contains a state whose first element is a critical marking and the second element is a noncritical marking. © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

abstract={The rapidly growing use of modern computer-integrated systems involving critical assets underscores the need for developing measures to guarantee their security against malicious attacks. This paper deals with the problem of language-based opacity formulation and verification in the framework of discrete event systems modeled with partially observed Petri nets (POPNs). In this context, a secret behavior is defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who partially observes the system's evolution. A Petri net system is qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first search on a portion of the system's execution. Complexity analysis and experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper addresses the problem of detection and prevention of cyber attacks in discrete event systems where the supervisor communicates with the plant via network channels. Random control delays may occur in such networked systems, hence the control of the supervisor could be affected. Furthermore, there is an attacker targeting the vulnerable actuators. The attacker can corrupt the control input generated by the supervisor, and aims at driving the plant to unsafe states. We propose a new approach to model the closed-loop system subject to control delays and attacks. The notion of AE-safe controllability in the networked control system is defined: it describes the ability to prevent the plant from reaching unsafe states after attacks are detected. A method for testing AE-safe controllability is also presented. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Opacity is an information flow property characterizing whether a system reveals its secret to an intruder. Verification of opacity for discrete-event systems modeled by automata is in general a hard problem. We discuss the question whether there are structural restrictions on the system models for which the opacity verification is tractable. We consider two kinds of automata models: (i) acyclic automata, and (ii) automata where all cycles are only in the form of self-loops. In some sense, these models are the simplest models of (deadlock-free) systems. Although the expressivity of such systems is weaker than the expressivity of linear temporal logic, we show that the opacity verification for these systems is still hard.

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the enforcement of opacity via supervisory control in the context of discrete-event systems. A system is said to be opaque if the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never infer confidentially that the system is at a secret state. The design objective is to synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even though the control policy is publicly known. We propose to use non-deterministic supervisors, provides a set of control decisions at each instant, to enforce opacity. Such a nondeterministic control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision cannot be implicitly inferred from the control policy. We provide an effective approach to synthesize a non-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. We show that non-deterministic supervisors are strictly more powerful than deterministic supervisors. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={In discrete-event systems, the opacity of a secret ensures that some behaviors or states cannot be inferred with certainty from partial observation of the system. Enforcing opacity in a discrete-event system, encoded by a finite labelled transition system (LTS), is a way to avoid information leakage. Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for constructing local controllers that enforces opacity for each secret separately.

abstract={Cyber-physical systems have been highly integrated into many contemporary infrastructures. As this integration deepens, the importance of protecting these systems from unauthorized access and data corruption increases. Nowadays, cyber-physical systems are not well protected against network attacks. One solution is to improve the security of a system by encrypting the transmitted data. In this paper, we consider the encryption of supervisors of discrete event systems modeled with deterministic finite-state automata. We propose an encryption framework of supervisory control systems based on the matrix notation of automata. The purpose of using matrix notation is to make it suitable for homomorphic encryption schemes over integers, which are emerging in the cryptography area. We calculate the entropy of the matrix notation and find that as the size of a system increases, it gets smaller and approaches zero. Owing to the low entropy of the matrix notation, we propose an algorithm to enhance its entropy. By applying the entropy-enhancing process, the distribution characteristics of entries in matrices or vectors can be hidden to avoid a brute force attack. Correspondingly, we propose an entropy restoration algorithm to ensure that the control action can be transmitted correctly. © 2013 IEEE.},

This paper focuses on presenting a matrix-based approach for verification of opacity of nondeterministic discrete event systems (DESs). Firstly, the given system is modeled as a finite-state automaton. Further, based on Boolean semi-tensor product (BSTP) of matrices, the algebraic expression of the observable dynamic of the system can be obtained. We, respectively, investigate current-state opacity and K-step opacity owing to the equivalence between a few opacity properties. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to verify whether the secret is opaque for a given system, and the proposed methodology is tested effectively by examples. The matrix-based characterization of opacity proposed in this paper may provide a helpful angel for understanding the structure of this property. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

We adopt the concept of opacity, an information flow security property, to characterize the security status of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that system has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder can never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the information-flow in the insecure channels. A new network observer is proposed to estimate the state of the system with two-side incomparable channel information. We show that the opacity verification problem for the networked setting can be effectively solved using the proposed network observer. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work, we study supervisory control of discrete event systems in the presence of network-based attacks on information delivered to and from the supervisors. The attacks are modeled by finite state transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible attack behavior is the desired one - we refer to such supervisors as attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the design algorithm for an attack-resilient supervisor, in scenarios where no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it. Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a desired language is controllable with intermittently secure communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach on several examples. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Opacity is an important information-flow property, which is used to characterize whether or not the secrets of system have been leaked to the intruders. Over the past ten years, opacity of discrete event systems (DESs) modeled as automata and Petri nets have been well investigated under the assumption that the communication channels between systems and intruders are perfect. However, in a shared network, the communication delays and losses are inevitable usually. In this paper, we investigate the problem of opacity of networked discrete event systems (NDESs). We propose the notions of current-state opacity, initial-state opacity, initial-final-state opacity, and infinite-step opacity for NDESs. We also present the verification algorithms for these notions. Some examples are provided to illustrate the results obtained. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider a multi-adversary version of the supervisory control problem for discrete-event systems (DES), in which an adversary corrupts the observations available to the supervisor. The supervisor’s goal is to enforce a specific language in spite of the opponent’s actions and without knowing which adversary it is playing against. This problem is motivated by applications to computer security in which a cyber defense system must make decisions based on reports from sensors that may have been tampered with by an attacker. We start by showing that the problem has a solution if and only if the desired language is controllable (in the DES classical sense) and observable in a (novel) sense that takes the adversaries into account. For the particular case of attacks that insert symbols into or remove symbols from the sequence of sensor outputs, we show that testing the existence of a supervisor and building the supervisor can be done using tools developed for the classical DES supervisory control problem, by considering a family of automata with modified output maps, but without expanding the size of the state space and without incurring on exponential complexity on the number of attacks considered. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={One of alternative ways to achieve a competitive advantage by an enterprise in the ICT area is to select the most prospective information system (IS) as a seed technology. The latter is defined as a first technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs, taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended variant of the above application may also provide decision support to developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply the best-possible technology development and market strategies. © 2019 IEEE.},

Sensors and actuators are elements of CPS that can be vulnerable to attacks. Sensor attacks typically consist in corrupting or hiding information received from sensors, or creating nonexisting information. Actuator attacks typically consist in intercepting and modifying orders sent to actuators. Attacks may lead to serious situations that we will call failures. We adopt a discrete event system (DES) approach, where information received from sensors and actions realized by actuators are represented as discrete events. We first develop a model of the attacked system using supervisory control of DES. Then, we study the defense viewpoint, where we develop methods to detect attacks and avoid failures, and determine conditions of attack detectability and failure avoidability. Then, we study the attacker's viewpoint, where we develop a strategy based on supervisory control of DES to make the attacker undetectable. © 2019 IEEE.},

The main contribution of this work is to extend these ideas to timed stochastic systems, by introducing and analyzing timing aspects of initial-state opacity, as measures of vulnerability to security violations. More specifically, we consider partially observed stochastic Petri net (POSPN) models that behave according to Markovian dynamics. We assume that certain events are observable to an outside observer (intruder) and we are interested in initial-state opacity, i.e., determining whether an intruder can infer that the initial marking of the system necessarily lies within a given secret set of initial states. In case initial-state opacity is violated for some behavior in the system, we are also interested in knowing how much time the system remains safe before this violation occurs. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a key technology in the development of distributed and autonomous large scale systems. However, one of their undesirable side effects is the fact that they are particularly exposed to cyber attacks carried out by malicious intruders. Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the plant under attack. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Rogue Twin Access Point (AP) is a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot/AP setup by an adversary solely with the purpose of luring Wi-Fi stations (STAs) into connecting to them. An adversary clones the Service Set IDentifier (SSID) [Hotspot Name] as well as the MAC address of the legitimate AP while setting up the rogue twin. When a STA checks for the list of available APs (under presence of rogue twin), it sees only one AP (despite there being two APs with the identical SSID and MAC address). In case the signal strength of the rogue twin is more than the legitimate AP, the STA connects to the rogue twin.In the present study, a Discrete Event System (DES) paradigm based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting rogue twin which is proposed. It overcomes many drawbacks of existing approaches in tackling rogue twin. A normal DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under normal network conditions along with a failure (attacker) DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under rogue twin network conditions is constructed. Using the knowledge of the normal and attacker DES models, a DES diagnoser is constructed to ascertain whether the frame exchange corresponds to a normal or attack condition. Even if an attacker uses multiple techniques to launch the rogue twin the proposed DES based IDS is capable of identifying all such possible instances. We validate the scheme on a real test bed. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last year, the Internet of Things (IoT) drove the development of cyber-physical systems, leading the convergence between information and operational technologies. This coupling improves performances and saves costs but increases the number of vulnerabilities and the attack surface to malicious actors. Consequently, it is mandatory to understand how IoT devices can be properly integrated into a more secure environment. This issue is even more crucial in the field of Critical Infrastructures, such as energy, water, transportation, and telecommunications. To this aim, this paper analyzes the concept of opacity for Discrete Event Systems (DES) and applies it to a real system. The opacity describes the ability of the system to keep some states secret even if an attacker knows the happening of some events. The proposed approach is validated by applying the concept of opacity on the analysis over a simple system. It is demonstrated that opacity can be guaranteed and exploited when systems having different levels of security are integrated. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This note investigates enforcement of opacity by nondeterministic edit functions. The edit functions alter the system's output by inserting fictitious events or erasing observed events. The edit decisions are randomly made while not known by the outside environment a priori. There is an intruder characterized as a passive observer with malicious goals to infer the secrets of the system. We require that opacity be enforced when the intruder may or may not know the implementation of edit functions. This requirement is termed as private and public safety. We also restrict the operation of edit functions by defining edit constraints. Then, the opacity enforcement problem is transformed to a three-player game among the edit function, the environment, and a dummy player, which helps to determine edit decisions. A game structure called the all edit structure (AES) is introduced to characterize the interaction among those players. It embeds all privately safe edit functions andmay also embed publicly safe edit functions. Based on the AES, we present an algorithm that provably synthesizes nondeterministic edit functions that satisfy both private safety and public safety. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the enforcement of opacity by insertion functions subject to multiple quantitative constraints capturing resource or energy limitations. There is a malicious intruder attempting to infer secrets of the system from its observations. To prevent the disclosure of secrets, the insertion function inserts fictitious events to the output of the system to obfuscate the intruder. The system is initialized with several types of resources, referred to as energy. The energy is consumed or replenished with event occurrences while always consumed with event insertions. The insertion function must enforce opacity while ensuring that each type of resource is never depleted. This problem is then reduced to a two-player game between the insertion function and the system (environment), with properly defined objectives. A game structure called the Energy Insertion Structure, denoted by EIS is proposed, which provably contains solutions to the energy constrained opacity enforcement problem. Then we further study the bounded cost rate insertion problem on the insertion function's winning region of EIS, which requires that the long run average rate of insertion cost be bounded. This problem is formulated as a multidimensional mean payoff game and a special method called hyperplane separation technique is applied to efficiently solve it. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={This paper deals with a problem related to the observability of discrete event systems: the initial-state opacity. Given a set of system states (the secret), a system observation is called initial-state opaque if an agent (named intruder), who can partially observe the system, cannot determine whether the set of initial states consistent with an event sequence is included in the secret. Such a character can describe security problems in cyber-infrastructures, such as Internet and mobile communication networks or national defense service systems. This work presents a novel on-line methodology to verify the notion of initial-state opacity of discrete event systems that are modeled by labeled Petri nets. By working on-line, the intruder records an event and exploits integer linear programming problem for checking the initial-state opacity of the system's evolution under the given observation. A set of examples are shown to shed light on the efficiency of the presented methodology. © 2019 ISA},

abstract={Since the beginning of the 21th century, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been targeted by hackers. The main motives for the interest to ICS is the ease for performing cyberattacks and the potential damages inflicted to the system and its environment in case of success. The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for detecting malicious orders in discrete-event system. Four types of attacks (direct, sequential, temporal and over-soliciting) that affect an industrial system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the “automation-knowledge”. Thus, by using models of system with an improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent. Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on simulation examples and an industrial platform. To conclude, improvements of our approach are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata.

In this paper, a controller encryption scheme for discrete event systems is presented that secures the communication and the information inside the controller. By adapting a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme to encrypt the controller parameters and variables, it is much more difficult for attackers to gather information about the controller and plant. The homomorphic encryption scheme allows the evaluation of encrypted data without additional decryption and encryption steps. Thus the controller can be evaluated completely in the encrypted domain. We show how to change a controller based on a signal interpreted Petri net (SIPN) into an encrypted SIPN controller and illustrate the approach by a simulation example. © 2019 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract={Wi-Fi technology has seen rapid growth in the last two decades. It has revolutionized the way we access the Internet. However, they are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack, the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin attacks in a Wi-Fi network. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The reliance of many emerging applications on shared cyber-infrastructures has prompted the study of various notions for security and privacy, including notions for deterministic, non-deterministic, and probabilistic systems. The main contribution of this work is to extend these ideas to timed stochastic systems, by introducing and analyzing opacity exposure as a measure of vulnerability to security violations. More specifically, we consider partially observed stochastic Petri net (POSPN) models that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., the time delays of all events are independent random variables and have exponential probability density functions). We assume that certain events and part of the marking trajectories are observable to an outside observer (intruder) who is interested in determining whether current-state opacity is violated (i.e., whether the intruder can infer with certainty that the marking of the system necessarily lies within a given secret set of states). In a timed system, as the POSPN considered in this paper, we are also interested in knowing how much time the intruder has to react in case current-state opacity is violated. We consider and analyze two critical aspects: (i) the frequency with which the system enters a time interval where an opacity violation occurs, and (ii) the amount of time the intruder has to take any malicious action. © 2019 EUCA.},

This paper provides an overview of existing approaches preventing damage caused by cyber attacks in the supervisory control of cyber-physical systems. The objective is to identify missing pieces, possible links and determine new directions for further research to improve the existing literature. For this purpose, first, we classify the current research works under a framework consisting of three dimensions: 1) the communication channel where an attack can happen, 2) the attack impact on the transmitted data, and 3) the mechanism to prevent damage. This classification will then help us to compare the existing techniques and investigate how they can be improved to get closer to the ideal scenario where most kinds of attacks can be handled so that the closed-loop system remains safe. © 2019 EUCA.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose and address the problem of supervisor obfuscation against actuator enablement attack, in a common setting where the actuator attacker can eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We propose a method to obfuscate an (insecure) supervisor to make it resilient against actuator enablement attack in such a way that the behavior of the original closed-loop system is preserved. An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability and observability constraints, which can be tackled by using SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors. © 2019 EUCA.},

abstract={Fault detection and diagnosis x0028 FDD x0029 facilitates reliable operation of systems. Various approaches have been proposed for FDD like Analytical redundancy x0028 AR x0029, Principal component analysis x0028 PCA x0029, Discrete event system x0028 DES x0029 model etc., in the literature. Performance of FDD schemes greatly depends on accuracy of the sensors which measure the system parameters. Due to various reasons like faults, communication errors etc., sensors may occasionally miss or report erroneous values of some system parameters to FDD engine, resulting in measurement inconsistency of these parameters. Schemes like AR, PCA etc., have mechanisms to handle measurement inconsistency, however, they are computationally heavy. DES based FDD techniques are widely used because of computational simplicity, but they cannot handle measurement inconsistency efficiently. Existing DES based schemes do not use Measurement inconsistent x0028 MI x0029 parameters for FDD. These parameters are not permanently unmeasurable or erroneous, so ignoring them may lead to weak diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a Measurement inconsistent discrete event system x0028 MIDES x0029 framework, which uses MI parameters for FDD at the instances they are measured by the sensors. Otherwise, when they are unmeasurable or erroneously reported, the MIDES invokes an estimator diagnoser that predicts the statex0028 s x0029 the system is expected to be in, using the subsequent parameters measured by the other sensors. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated using a pump-valve system. In addition, an MIDES based intrusion detection system has been developed for detection of rogue dynamic host configuration protocol x0028 DHCPx0029 server attack by mapping the attack to a fault in the DES framework. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={Communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers to monitor and control cyber-physical systems (CPS). The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of the CPS to cyber attacks that can drive the system to reach unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyber attacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create or replace information in the attacked network channel. In a previous paper, we have introduced the definition of NA-Safe controllability, that is related with the capability of detecting intrusions and preventing damages caused by man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels in supervisory control systems. In this paper, we extend our previous work as follows: (i) we prove the correctness of the NA-Safe controllability verification algorithm; (ii) we show how to implement the security module against cyber attacks; (iii) we show that NA-Safe controllability is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of the security module; and (iv) we present a practical example to illustrate the results of the paper. © 2018, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.},

abstract={Opacity is an important information-flow property that arises in security and privacy analysis of cyber–physical systems. Among many different notions of opacity, K-step opacity requires that the intruder can never determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret state for any specific instant within K steps prior to that particular instant. This notion becomes infinity-step opacity when K goes to infinity. Existing works on the analysis of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a system is either opaque or non-opaque. To analyze infinite-step and K-step opacity more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity in the context of stochastic discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost infinite-step opacity (respectively, almost K-step opacity), is proposed to capture whether or not the probability of violating infinite-step opacity (respectively, K-step opacity) is smaller than a given threshold. We also provide effective algorithms for the verification of almost infinite-step opacity and almost K-step opacity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The deployment of control systems with network-connected components has made feedback control systems vulnerable to attacks over the network. This paper considers the problem of intrusion detection and mitigation in supervisory control systems, where the attacker has the ability to enable or disable vulnerable actuator commands and erase or insert vulnerable sensor readings. We present a mathematical model for the system under certain classes of actuator enablement attacks, sensor erasure attacks, or sensor insertion attacks. We then propose a defense strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of unsafe system states. The technical condition of interest that is necessary and sufficient in this context, termed “GF-safe controllability” is characterized. We show that the verification of GF-safe controllability can be performed using diagnoser or verifier automata. Finally, we illustrate the methodology with a traffic control system example. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

An operator observes the plant through an observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted by an intruder who can insert and erase some sensor readings. We construct an attack structure A which guarantees that, when the plant reaches an unsafe state, A can make the operator think that the plant is in a safe state. Based on A, we can obtain a stealthy attack structure As by simply removing from A all the exposing states, all the weakly exposing states and their input and output arcs. The stealthy attack structure As only contains the possible attacks that can not be detected by the operator. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Opacity is a security and privacy property that evaluates whether an external observer (intruder) can infer a secret of a system by observing its behavior. This paper proposes an on-line approach to address the problem of current-state opacity in discrete event systems (DESs) modeled in a labeled Petri Net (PN) framework and by observing its evolution. An observation of the system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder is unable to determine whether the current state of the system is within a set of secret states, otherwise it is said to be not current-state opaque. The proposed approach to verify the current-state opacity works on-line: the verification algorithm waits for the occurrence of an observable event and uses Integer Linear Programming problem solutions to verify if the behavior of the system is current-state opaque to the intruder under the given observation. Moreover, the proposed method is applied in two different settings: (i) a centralized approach where the intruder has full knowledge of the system model but can partially observe the system behavior; (ii) a decentralized approach where a set of intruders can observe different event sets and collaborate with a coordinator to disclose the same secret. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={One of the major challenges about cyber–physical systems is how to protect system integrity from cyber attacks. There has been a large number of different types of attacks discussed in the literature. In this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system, aiming to trick a given supervisor to issue improper control commands, which can drive the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker's point of view, and formulate an attack-with-bounded-sensor-reading-alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be computed, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which computes a supervisor that is ABSRA-robust in the sense that any ABSRA will either be detectable or inflict no damage to the system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

We adopt the concept of an information-flow property called opacity to capture whether or not the networked supervisory control system is secure. Specifically, we say that the supervisory control system is opaque with insecure control channel if the intruder can never determine for sure that the system is in a secret state based on the control decisions sent by the supervisor.

abstract={We study the enforcement of opacity, an information-flow security property, using insertion functions that insert fictitious events at the output of the system. The intruder is characterized as a passive external observer whose malicious goal is to infer system secrets from observed traces of system events. We consider the problems of enforcing opacity under the assumption that the intruder either knows or does not know the structure of the insertion function; we term this requirement as public–private enforceability. The case of private enforceability alone, where the intruder does not know the form of the insertion function, is solved in our prior work. In this paper, we address the stronger requirement of public–private enforceability, that requires opacity be preserved even if the intruder knows or discovers the structure of the insertion function. We formulate the concept of public–private enforceability by defining the notion of public safety. This leads to the notion of public–private enforcing (PP-enforcing) insertion functions. We then identify a necessary and sufficient condition for an insertion function to be PP-enforcing. We further show that if opacity is privately enforceable by the insertion mechanism, then it is also public–private enforceable. Using these results, we present a new algorithm to synthesize PP-enforcing insertion functions by a greedy-maximal strategy. This algorithm is the first of its kind to guarantee opacity when insertion functions are made public or discovered by the intruder. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In many emerging security applications, a system designer frequently needs to ensure that a certain property of a given system (that may reveal important details about the system’s operation) be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (eavesdroppers). Motivated by such applications, several researchers have formalized, analyzed, and described methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems of interest. This paper introduces and analyzes a notion of opacity in systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata or hidden Markov models. We consider a setting where a user needs to choose a specific hidden Markov model (HMM) out of m possible (different) HMMs, but would like to “hide” the true system from eavesdroppers, by not allowing them to have an arbitrary level of confidence as to which system has been chosen. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions (that can be checked with polynomial complexity), under which the intruder cannot distinguish the true HMM, namely, the intruder cannot achieve a level of certainty about its decision, which is above a certain threshold that we can a priori compute. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Opacity is an important information-flow property that arises in security and privacy analysis of cyber-physical systems. It captures the plausible deniability of the system's 'secret' in the presence of a malicious intruder modeled as a passive observer. As a specific type of opacity, infinite-step opacity requires that the intruder can never determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret system for any specific instant in the past. Existing works on the analysis of infinite-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a system is either opaque or non-opaque. However, a non-infinite-step-opaque system may only have a small probability of violation; this may be still tolerable in many applications. To analyze infinite-step opacity more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate the verification of infinite-step opacity in the context of stochastic discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost infinite-step opacity, is proposed to capture whether or not the probability of violating infinite-step opacity is smaller than a given threshold. This notion is weaker than its purely logical counter-part as it takes the transition probability of the system into account. We also provide an effective algorithm for the verification of almost infinite-step opacity. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the context of the supervisory control layer. Specifically, we propose a general model of a CPS attacker in the framework of Discrete Event Systems (DES) and investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given controlled system. Our model captures a class of deception attacks, where the attacker has the ability to modify a subset of sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an undesirable state. We introduce a new type of a bipartite transition structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA), to capture the game-like interaction between the supervisor and the environment (which includes the system and attacker). This structure is a discrete transition system that embeds information about all possible attacker's stealthy actions, and all states (some possibly unsafe) that become reachable as a result of those actions. We present a procedure for the construction of the IDA and discuss its properties. Based on the IDA, we discuss the characterization of successful stealthy attacks, i.e., attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the system. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are increasingly deployed in critical infrastructures. Originally designed to increase the productivity of ICS as well as safety and reliability, nowadays these systems are becoming the target of hackers. Several attacks highlighted vulnerabilities, the most relevant one, Stuxnet, stroke in 2010. Protection of ICS against cyberattacks has to be considered. Security of these systems is different from IT security solutions because exchanged data have physical consequences. For that, a new approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in ICS was presented based on filters monitoring orders and reports. Methodology to obtain these filters and their locations in the ICS architecture were introduced. In this paper, we present major improvements in detection mechanisms of these filters. Distance concept, introduced in previous paper (Sicard et al., 2017), is developed and combined to trajectory concept that allows filters to detect deviations from expected behavior. Distance from optimal or forbidden states is essential to compute order sequence bringing back the system into safe states. Trajectory, which is the evolution of distance during state evolution, improves detection mechanism by analyzing sequences sent to the system and received by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This combinational security prevents damages against goods and people. Implementation of time based intrusion detection is a step forward for improving filters. Temporal windows indicate when actions have to be done and if received reports correspond to executed orders. Thus, our filter approach secures ICS against combinational and temporal attacks affecting security of goods and people or quality. © 2018},

abstract={Nowadays, the systems developed to integrate real physical processes and virtual computational processes — the cyber-physical systems (CPS), are used in multiple areas of industry and critical national infrastructure, such as manufacturing, medicine, traffic management and security, automotive engineering, industrial process control, energy saving, ecological management, industrial robots, technical infrastructure management, distributed robotic systems, protection target systems, nanotechnology and biological systems technology. With wide use, the level of IT and cyberrisks increases drastically and successful attacks against the CPS will lead to unmanageable and unimaginable consequence. Thus, the need in well-designed risk assessment system of CPS is clear and such system can provide an overall view of CPS security status and support efficient allocations of safeguard resources. The nature of CPS differs from IT mainly with the requirement for real-time operations, thus, traditional risk assessment method for IT system can be adopted in CPS. Design of a unified modelling language based domain specific language described in this paper achieves synergy from in IT industry widely used UML modelling technique and the domain specific risk management extensions. As a novelty for UML modelling, especially for simulation purposes, the presented DSL is enriched by a set of stochastic attributes of modelled activities. Such stochastic attributes are usable for further implementation of discrete-event system simulators. © 2018 St. Petersburg Institute for Informatics and Automation of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

abstract={We investigate the problem of synthesizing dynamic masks that preserve infinite-step opacity in the context of discrete-event systems. A system equipped with a dynamic mask, which acquires information dynamically by turning sensors on/off, is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all information acquired can never infer that the system was at some secret state for some specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem only consider current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for infinite-step opacity, a notion stronger than current-state opacity, is much more challenging. The main reason is that delayed information is involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret will be revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture all delayed information in the infinite-step opacity problem. An effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem. Our result extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity. © 2018},

abstract={Opacity is a property of discrete event systems (DES) that is related to the possibility of hiding a secret to external observers (the intruders). The secret can be either a system state, or a sequence of events executed by the system itself. When the latter type of secrets is considered, the opacity property is referred to as language-based opacity (LBO). This paper deals with LBO when the DES is modeled by a labeled Petri net. One necessary and sufficient condition to check LBO by solving Integer Linear Programming problems is given; such a condition exploits the algebraic representation of Petri nets. A sufficient condition is then derived, which is less demanding from the computational point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of examples. © 2018},

abstract={Wi-Fi devices have limited battery life because of which conserving battery life is imperative. The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame (s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA (s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame (s) to retrieve the buffered frame (s) of the sleeping STA (s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA (s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios. © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the prominent network security attacks. In DDoS attack several machines send large amount of network traffic to the victim using spoofed IP address. Unfortunately there is no reliable technique to detect spoofed IP packets. In this paper we argue that, a proactive detection of spoofed IP packets will help in predicting DDoS attacks. In this paper we describe an event based detection method to identify spoofed IP packets. Our method works by proactively probing received packets for genuineness. Active probing technique uses inconsistencies in TTL values of received packets to decide whether the first packet was spoofed or genuine. We enumerate several possible spoofing scenarios with our detection method in place and identify its type based on the response to probing. Further, we study limitations of event based method and discuss ways to overcome those. We design and experiment with all spoofing scenarios in a real network setup and report the results. With few optimizations done to the probing strategy, the overhead incurred can be minimized considerably, which makes the proposed technique useful for detecting DDoS attacks. © 2017},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers to monitor and control physical systems. The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of the CPS to cyber attacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyber attacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create or replace information in the attacked network channel. We propose in this paper a defense strategy that detects intrusions and prevent damages caused by man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels in supervisory control systems. We also introduce the definition of NA-Safe controllability, and we propose an algorithm to verify this property. © 2017},

abstract={This paper focuses on the Fallback Control System (FCS), which is an emergency response method of networked Industrial Control System (ICS) as a countermeasure for cyber-attacks. The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment. © 2017},

There has been a large number of different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and computer science communities. In this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system in order to trick a given supervisor to issue control commands improperly, driving the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker point of view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. © 2017 American Automatic Control Council (AACC).},

This work addresses the verification of state-based opacity in systems modeled with Petri nets. The secret behavior of a system is defined as a set of states. More precisely, two state-based opacity properties are considered: current-state opacity and initial-state opacity. We show that both current-state and initial-state opacity problems in bounded Petri nets can be efficiently solved by using a compact representation of the reachability graph, called basis reachability graph (BRG). This approach is practically efficient since the exhaustive enumeration of the reachability space can be avoided. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

We present new algorithms for the verification of the properties of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity for partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as finite-state automata. Our new algorithms are based on a novel separation principle for state estimates that characterizes the information dependence in opacity verification problems, and they have lower computational complexity than previously-proposed ones in the literature. Specifically, we propose a new information structure, called the two-way observer, that is used for the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity. Based on the two-way observer, a new upper bound for the delay in K-step opacity is derived, which also improves previously-known results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={While cryptography is used to protect the content of information (e.g., a message) by making it undecipherable, behaviors (as opposed to information) may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity (by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from secrets). Having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper, we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation for the proposed measure is also presented. Illustrative examples, including the one with side-channel attack, are provided to demonstrate the proposed computation approach. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Current-state opacity is a key security property in discrete event systems. A system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder, who only has partial observations on the system's evolution, is never able to infer that the current state of the system is within a set of secret states. In this work, we address the problem of enforcing current-state opacity by supervisory control. Given a system that is modeled with a finite automaton and that is not current-state opaque with respect to a given secret, the enforcement problem consists in designing a supervisor so that the controlled system is current-state opaque. We assume that the supervisor can only observe and control a subset of events. To be more general, we assume no specific containment relationship exists between the sets of events that can be observed by the intruder and the supervisor, respectively. We call this general setting uncomparable observations. We show that the maximally permissive supervisor always exists and propose a novel approach for its design. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In many emerging security applications, a system designer frequently needs to ensure that a certain property of a given system (that may reveal important details about the system's operation) be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (eavesdroppers or intruders). Motivated by such applications, several researchers have formalized, analyzed, and described methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems of interest. This paper introduces and analyzes a notion of opacity in systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata or hidden Markov models. We consider a setting where a user needs to choose a specific hidden Markov model (HMM) out of m possible (different) HMMs, but would like to hide the true system from intruders, by not allowing them to have an arbitrary level certainty as to which system has been chosen. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions (that can be checked with polynomial complexity), under which the intruder cannot distinguish the true HMM, namely, the intruder cannot achieve a level of certainty about its decision that is above a certain threshold that we can a priori compute. © 2016 IEEE.},

A system is said to be infinite-step opaque (respectively, K-step opaque) if the intruder can never determine for sure that the system was in a secret state for any instant within infinite steps (respectively, K steps) prior to that particular instant. We derive a new separation principle for state estimates which characterizes the information dependence in this opacity verification problem. A new information structure called the two-way observer is proposed. Based on the two-way observer, we provide new algorithms for the verification of infinite-step opacity and the verification of K-step opacity, respectively.

The local observers collude and exchange their observations over communication channels that introduce bounded delays.

Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is a possible means of quantifying statistical difference between two distributions and can be used to measure such information leak as is presented in this chapter. Using JSD, we quantify loss of secrecy in stochastic partially-observed discrete event systems in two settings: (i) the centralized setting, corresponding to a single attacker/observer, and (ii) the distributed collusive setting, corresponding to multiple attackers/observers, exchanging their observed information. In the centralized case, an observer structure is formed and used to aide the computation of JSD, in the limit, as the length of observations approach infinity to quantify the worst case loss of secrecy. In the distributed collusive case, channel models are introduced to extend the system model to capture the effect of exchange of observations, that allows the JSD computation of the centralized case to be applied over the extended model to measure the distributed secrecy loss. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

However, not much consideration was given on studying the possibility of attackers exploiting the protocol, which has lead to several attacks on TCP. This paper deals with the induced low rate TCP attack. Since the attack is relatively new, only a few schemes have been proposed to mitigate it. However, the main issues with these schemes are scalability, change in TCP header, lack of formal frameworks, etc. In this paper, we have adapted the stochastic DES framework for detecting the attack, which addresses most of these issues.

abstract={The diagnosability condition for a Discrete Event System (DES) model requires that there exists no failureindeterminate cycles in the DES diagnoser for all failure types. This stringent requirement of DES diagnosability condition renders many systems non-diagnosable. I-diagnosability framework provides a weaker notion of diagnosability than DES diagnosability by considering only those failures that are followed by certain observable event(s) known as indicator events. However, some systems are I-non-diagnosable even in the presence of an indicator event following the failure event. In this paper, we propose I2-diagnosability framework overcomes the shortcomings of the I-diagnosability framework. In I2-DES framework an empowering event ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully. We have considered a practical example of Advanced Stealth Man in the Middle attack in Wi-Fi networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed I2-DES framework wherein the I-DES framework fails. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We focus on the control and the synthesis of secure timed systems which are modelled as timed automata. The security property that the system must satisfy is a non-interference property. Intuitively, non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from a high-level domain to a lower level domain. Various notions of non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper, we focus on strong non-deterministic non-interference (SNNI) and two (bi)simulation-based variants thereof (cosimulation-based SNNI and bisimulation-based SNNI). These properties and their extensions have been mostly studied in the context of discrete event systems, while it is now well-known that time is an important attack vector against secure systems.At the same time, there is an obvious interest in going beyond simple verification to control problems: to be able to automatically make systems secure.We consider non-interference properties in the challenging setting of control of dense-time systems specified by timed automata and we study the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes, (2) compute a (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent.We exhibit decidable sub-classes for these problems, assess their theoretical complexities and provide effective algorithms based on the classical framework of timed games. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The rapidly changing battle conditions in modern network-centric operations prescribe expectations for speedy deployment and nimble ad hoc reconfiguration of military networked teams. In this paper, a formal command and control (C2) structure is presented that allows for reliable ad hoc reconfiguration of tasks and resources of multiple simultaneous missions. Missions and assigned resources can be removed or added in an online manner without affecting other running missions. A mathematically justified software tool called the Reconfigurable Discrete Event Control (RDEC) is proposed by extending an existing framework using simple matrix decomposition. The RDEC effectively allows multiple fighting platforms of different interdisciplinary fields to join and leave the network easily in a “plug-and-play” manner. The proposed C2 structure is developed and demonstrated on a simulation study involving a Singapore armed forces team with three realistic attack missions. Extensive simulation results verify that the networked team is fairly sequenced and the missions and resources can be removed or added without blocking effects. © 2015, The Author(s).

abstract={Diagnosis of a system consists in providing explanations to a supervisor from a partial observation of the system and a model of possible executions. This paper proposes a partial order diagnosis algorithm that recovers sets of scenarios which correspond to a given observation. Systems are modeled using High-level Message Sequence Charts (HMSCs), and the diagnosis is given as a new HMSC, which behaviors are all explanations of the partial observation. The main difficulty is that some actions of the monitored system are unobservable but may still induce some causal ordering among observed events. We first give an offline centralized diagnosis algorithm, then we discuss a decentralized version of this algorithm. We then give an online diagnosis algorithm, and define syntactic criteria under which the memory used can be bounded. This allows us to give a complete diagnosis framework for infinite state systems, with a strong emphasis on concurrency and causal ordering in behaviors. The last contribution of the paper is an application of diagnosis techniques to a security problem called anomaly detection. Anomaly detection consists in comparing what occurs in the system with usual/expected behaviors, and raising an alarm when some unusual behavior (meaning a potential attack) occurs. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Cyber Security Model of Artificial Social System Man-Machine takes advantage of an important chapter of artificial intelligence, discrete event systems applied for modelling and simulation of control, logistic supply, chart positioning, and optimum trajectory planning of artificial social systems. "An artificial social system is a set of restrictions on agents` behaviours in a multi-agent environment. Its role is to allow agents to coexist in a shared environment and pursue their respective goals in the presence of other agents" (Moses & Tennenholtz, n.d.). Despite conventional approaches, Cyber Security Model of Artificial Social System Man-Machine is not guided by rigid control algorithms but by flexible, eventadaptable ones that makes them more lively and available. All these allow a new design of artificial social systems dotted with intelligence, autonomous decision-making capabilities, and self-diagnosing properties. Heuristics techniques, data mining planning activities, scheduling algorithms, automatic data identification, processing, and control represent as many trumps for these new systems analyzing formalism. The authors challenge these frameworks to model and simulate the interaction of man-machine in order to have a better look at the human, social, and organizational privacy and information protection. © 2015 by IGI Global.

This paper offers a review of various definitions of opacity, along with methodologies for their verification and complexity analysis. We review state-based notions of opacity (namely, current-state opacity and initial-state opacity) in non-deterministic finite automata, as well as their extensions to stochastic settings.

abstract={Opacity is a confidentiality property that characterizes whether a "secret" of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an "intruder". In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. We define the property of "i-enforceability" that an insertion function needs to satisfy in order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion function's ability to respond to every system's observed behavior and to output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing a structure called the "All Insertion Structure" (AIS). The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder - at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This notion of opacity has been studied in nondeterministic finite automata settings (where the intruder observes a subset of events, for example, via some natural projection mapping) and has been shown to be useful in characterizing security requirements in many applications (including encryption using pseudorandom generators and coverage properties in sensor networks). One limitation of the majority of existing analysis is that it fails to provide a quantifiable measure of opacity for a given system; instead, it simply provides a binary characterization of the system (being opaque or not opaque). In this paper, we address this limitation by extending current-state opacity formulations to systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata under partial observation. We introduce three notions of opacity, namely: 1) step-based almost current-state opacity; 2) almost current-state opacity; and 3) probabilistic current-state opacity, all of which can be used to provide a measure of a given system's opacity. We also propose verification methods for these probabilistic notions of opacity and characterize their corresponding computational complexities. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, motivated by the desire to incorporate probabilistic (likelihood) information, we extend the notion of initial state opacity to stochastic discrete event systems. Specifically, we consider systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata, and introduce and analyze the notions of almost initial state opacity and step-based almost initial state opacity, both of which hinge on the a priori probability that the given system generate behavior that violates initial-state opacity.

The verification of initial-state opacity has been shown to be a PSPACE-complete problem by establishing that it is equivalent to the language containment problem. In this paper we take a slightly different viewpoint and try to assess the ability of a user (who is dictating the activity in the system and indirectly the observations generated) to avoid revealing to the outside observer that the initial state of the system lied within the set of secret states S. A system that does not allow the user to act indefinitely in such a way is said to posses the property of resolution of initial state with respect to S. We show that in discrete event systems that can be modeled as non-deterministic labeled finite automata, this property can be verified with polynomial complexity in a way that resembles the verification of diagnosability. © 2012 IEEE.},

Specifically, a system is infinite-step opaque if the entrance of the system state, at any particular instant, to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain), for the length of the system operation, to an intruder who observes system activity through some projection map. Infinite-step opacity can be used to characterize the security requirements in many applications, including encryption using pseudo-random generators, coverage properties in sensor networks, and anonymity requirements in protocols for web transactions. We show that infinite-step opacity can be verified via the construction of a set of appropriate initial state estimators and provide illustrative examples.

abstract={Opacity is a confidentiality property that arises in the analysis of security properties in networked systems. It characterizes whether a 'secret' of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an 'intruder.' We consider the problem of enforcing opacity in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable strings. We define the property of 'i-enforceability,' when there exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and construct a new structure called the 'All Insertion Structure' (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The various fields of application for miniature air vehicles often do not provide distinct landing areas or even require additional equipment like nets or parachutes to land the aircraft without damaging it. This work introduces the deep stall landing (DSL) as a maneuver that uses the extraordinary aerodynamic characteristics of a delta wing MAV that come into effect after the angle of attack passes the stall angle. This landing maneuver is modeled based on a longitudinal aerodynamic model that takes lift, drag, thrust, weight, and pitching moment into account. By determining the operational modes that the aircraft has to perform in order to either complete the landing maneuver or abort it in case of a missed approach a hybrid system is identified. This system contains both continuous and discrete state dynamics that model the aircraft in each landing phase. Based on this hybrid system reachability analyses are performed which utilize level set methods to calculate backwards reachable sets. These sets are used to identify transitions within the modeled system that bring the aircraft form one operational mode to another without leaving the safe flight envelope. The final result is a discrete event system that covers all possible transitions within the refined model. Based on this discrete model an autonomous system can be implemented that is able to determine whether the initiation of the landing maneuver is safe in terms of keeping the aircraft within the safe flight envelope during the whole maneuver. Furthermore the results of the reachability analysis determine for which states of the aircraft it would be safe to initiate a recovery maneuver in case of a missed landing approach. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software that monitors network activities and raises alerts on detection of malicious behavior. State-transition based framework like Finite State Machines (FSM), extended FSM, timed FSM, Discrete Event Systems (DES) etc. are widely used in network IDSs because the framework enables formal modeling, analysis, verification etc. The attack detection capability in these IDSs is based on passive monitoring of sequence of events with the assumption that intrusions lead to change in the sequence (which needs to be detected). However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive monitoring. In this paper we propose an IDS to detect ARP spoofing attacks using active state-transition framework called "active DES". © 2011 IEEE.},

In this paper we reformulate the detection method proposed in [1] using renewal theory, providing several useful extensions. This reformulation also leads to a method that would be applicable to numerous real life signals that exist as discrete events, e.g., biological signals. Most importantly renewal theory allows us to characterize the performance of our detector and determine theoretical bounds on the time-to-detection. Compared to alternative methods that use frequency spectra or event arrival rates for detection our method is shown to be superior in terms of time-to-detection. Further, unlike rate based techniques, our method can estimate the multiple periods when multiple periodic anomalies occur simultaneously. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for determining the link layer or Medium Access Control (MAC) address of a network host, given its Internet Layer (IP) or Network Layer address. ARP is a stateless protocol and any IPMAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IPMAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IPMAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IPMAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IPMAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IPMAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed. © 2010 ISA.

Initial-state opacity requires that the membership of the system initial state to a given set of secret states S remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder who has complete knowledge of the system model and observes system activity through some natural projection map. In the modular setting we consider, the given system is modeled as a composition (synchronous product) of M modules -G1,G 2,., GM) where each module Gi is a non-deterministic finite automaton with Ni states with the set of secret states S is of the form S = {(x1, x2,., xM)|x i ε Si}, where Si is the set of secret states for module Gi. Assuming that the pairwise shared events are pairwise observable and that the intruder observes events that are observable in at least one module, we provide a modular algorithm for verifying initial-state opacity with O(MNM-12N2) state and time complexity, where N = maxi Ni. This is a considerable reduction compared to the O(2(NM)2 ) state and time complexity of the centralized verification method, which verifies initial-state opacity by considering the composed system as a monolithic system.},

abstract={Motivated by security and privacy considerations in applications of discrete event systems, various notions of opacity have been introduced. Specifically, a system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder - at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This notion, which has been studied in non-deterministic finite automaton settings where the intruder observes a subset of events, has been shown to be useful in characterizing security requirements in many applications (including encryption using pseudo-random generators and trajectory coverage of a mobile agent in sensor networks). One limitation of these existing approaches is that they fail to provide a quantifiable measure for characterizing the degree of opacity of a given system. In this paper, we partially address this limitation by extending this framework to systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata, characterizing in the process the probability of observing a violation of current-state opacity. We introduce the notion of step-based almost current-state opacity which provides a measure of opacity for a given system. We also propose a verification method for this probabilistic notion of opacity and characterize its computational complexity. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={When designers and developers create software they often overlook issues related to security. Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural, similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finitestale machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory' to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Initial-state opacity emerges as a key property in numerous security applications of discrete event systems including key-stream generators for cryptographic protocols. Specifically, a system is initial-state opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret states remains uncertain (opaque) to an outside intruder who observes system activity through a given projection map. In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing a minimally restrictive opacityenforcing supervisor (MOES) which limits the system's behavior within some pre-specified legal behavior while enforcing the initial-state opacity requirement. To tackle this problem, we extend the state-based definition of initial-state opacity to languages and characterize the solution to MOES in terms of the supremal element of certain controllable, observable and opaque languages. We also derive conditions under which this supremal element exists and show how the initial-state estimator, which was introduced in our earlier work for verifying initialstate opacity, can be used to implement the solution to MOES. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization (OO) is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at "order" in performances among designs instead of "value" and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the OO solution, is a key step in applying the OO method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of military theories involve both concurrent processing units and discrete event systems. These can be best modeled with Petri nets. The maneuver theory includes preemption, dislocation, and disruption. Among them, dislocation plays a central role. We use Petri nets to model the dislocation strategy and, further, the combined-arms theory, which is an extension of the dislocation theory. Each attacking, moving, and defending unit is modeled as an object whose operation is represented as a subnet. Simulation can also be done with the appropriate integration of these Petri net submodels.},
