abstract = {Since the beginning of the 21th century, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) have been targeted by hackers. The main motives for the interest to ICS is the ease for performing cyberattacks and the potential damages inflicted to the system and its environment in case of success. The purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for detecting malicious orders in discrete-event system. Four types of attacks (direct, sequential, temporal and over-soliciting) that affect an industrial system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the “automation-knowledge”. Thus, by using models of system with an improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent. Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on simulation examples and an industrial platform. To conclude, improvements of our approach are discussed.}

We consider a maze solving problem in which two agents must search an unknown maze as fast and as securely as possible. We formulate this problem using a discrete-event systems framework and present a coordination strategy for two agents to search a simple maze that involves no communication, thereby eliminating any cyber-security threats. Our strategy involves two agents having reverse priority decision-making policies, while searching the maze with a depth-first search control policy. Under our definition of inefficiency, which is a function of the number of dead end states that are searched by both agents, we show that our method achieves the minimum inefficiency cost, and thus performs as well as any communication-based solution.}

abstract = {Resilience is a critical criterion to evaluate a networked system including discrete-event systems (DESs). This research touches upon the supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption. Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated through examples.}

The general purpose for multi-agent coordination is to synthesize a plan such that the LTL task is achieved optimally. In addition to the standard requirement on the correctness of the plan, we further investigate the potential information leakage of each agent during the operating process. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the behavior of each individual agent is partially monitored by a passive intruder modeled as an outside observer or an eavesdropper. The security constraint requires that the intruder can never identify for sure that some specific individual agent is carrying out some sub-tasks of significant importance. To this end, we model the mobile capability of the agent team by a global labeled transition system. To describe information-flow security constraint, motivated by the generic notion of opacity, two different types security requirements are proposed for each individual agent. An effective coordination algorithm is proposed that synthesizes an optimal global plan for the entire agent team such that the global LTL task can be achieved, while the security of each individual agent is preserved. The proposed framework is implemented in real-world experiment and is also demonstrated by several case studies.}

The attacker can corrupt the control input generated by the supervisor, and aims at driving the plant to unsafe states.

Such a non-deterministic control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision cannot be implicitly inferred from the control policy.

As an information-flow property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous “hold on” events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations.}

abstract = {In many security applications, system behaviors must be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (intruders). Opacity was first studied for discrete event systems, and then it was extended to real-time systems. One of the challenges of real-time systems is the difficulty to guarantee their opacity against a potential attacker. In general, this property is undecidable for systems modeled by timed automata. A secret location, S, of a system is timed opaque to an intruder having partial observability of the system, if the intruder can never infer from the observation of any execution that the system has reached any secret location. In the present study, the static partial observability for systems modeled by nondeterministic timed automata is investigated. Thus, it focuses on systems where the timing of secret state reachability is bounded. The first contribution of this study is to define the bounded timed opacity property wherein, its complexity is proved. The second contribution is to consider systems where the secret should be kept hidden for a certain period referred to as the Δ-duration bounded opacity property. Also, a formal definition is proposed and its complexity is proved. In addition, the proposed properties are verified using timed bounded model checking. A case study ”Exchange in the Cloud system” is modeled by timed automaton to verify the proposed properties using SpaceEx tool.}

abstract = {The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization (OO) is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at “order” in performances among designs instead of “value” and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the OO solution, is a key step in applying the OO method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended.}

This work deals with the problem of current-state opacity formulation and verification in the context of discrete event systems modelled with partially observed Petri nets (POPNs) (i.e., Petri nets containing place sensors that measure the number of tokens in observable places and event sensors that indicate the firing of observable transitions). A Petri net system is recognized as current-state opaque if the current-state estimate is never entirely contained in the set of secret states. In this regard, we introduce the notion of discernible markings to design a reduced state estimator called a discernible reachability graph, and then come up with formal modelling of current-state opacity in POPN systems. The main idea of the proposed approach consists in proving that if a system is current-state opaque, its current-state estimate, possibly established by an intruder, contains at least one non-secret state. We exploit the mathematical feasibility to formulate this concept by defining and solving an integer linear programming problem with respect to a given secret and an observation sequence collected from sensors. In the light of the proposed modelling, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for opacity verification, and examples are given to expose the results.}

This paper proposes the use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack models presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The least-unsafe (LU) supervisor problem is introduced to minimize this unsafe likelihood measure and improve existing attack mitigation techniques.

In our k-memory-embedded insertion mechanism, the insertion functions are determined based on the knowledge of system’s exact states and the stored next sequence of events with length k. Especially, we define the property of ik-E-enforceability that a k-memory-embedded insertion function needs to satisfy for opacity enforcement, and further construct a verifier to determine whether a given opacity notion of the system is ik-E-enforceable or not. Our mechanism improves the embedded insertion mechanism by applying to a broader class of systems.

We propose two information structures called an ∞-step recognizer and a k-step recognizer to verify these two properties. The complexities of our algorithms to verify strong infinite- and k-step opacity are O(22⋅|X|⋅|Eo|) and O(2(k+2)⋅|X|⋅|Eo|), respectively, which are lower than that of existing methods in the literature (|X| and |Eo| are the numbers of states and observable events in a plant, respectively). We also derive an upper bound for the value of k in strong k-step opacity, and propose an effective algorithm to determine the maximal value of k for a given plant. Finally, we note that enforcement of strong infinite- and k-step opacity can be transformed into a language specification enforcement problem and hence be solved using supervisory control.}

The FCS is disposed on not networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS. Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer. This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via a practical experiment.}

In other words, based on observations through this map (and complete knowledge of the system model), the intruder can never be certain (and will never be certain) that the system state at any point in time evolves (or has evolved) to the set of secret states.

Initial-state opacity requires that the membership of the system initial state to a given set of secret states S remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder who has complete knowledge of the system model and observes system activity through some natural projection map. In the modular setting we consider, the given system is modeled as a composition (synchronous product) of M modules [G1, G2, …, GM] where each module Gi is a non-deterministic finite automaton with Ni states with the set of secret states S is of the form S = [(x1, x2, …, xM)|xi Si], where Si is the set of secret states for module Gi. Assuming that the pairwise shared events are pairwise observable and that the intruder observes events that are observable in at least one module, we provide a modular algorithm for verifying initial-state opacity with O(MNM–12N2) state and time complexity, where N = maxi Ni. This is a considerable reduction compared to the O(2(NM)2) state and time complexity of the centralized verification method, which verifies initial-state opacity by considering the composed system as a monolithic system.}

abstract = {We introduce a discrete-event artificial neural network structure inspired by biological neural networks. It includes dynamic components and has variable structure. The network’s topology and its dynamic components are modifiable and trainable for different applications. Such adaptation in the network’s parameters, structure, and dynamic components makes it easier to adapt to varying behaviors due to the problem’s structure than other types of networks. We demonstrate that this type of network structure can detect random changes in packet arrival rates in computer network traffic with possible applications in cyber security.}

abstract = {Opacity is a security and privacy property that evaluates whether an external observer (intruder) can infer a secret of a system by observing its behavior. This paper proposes an on-line approach to address the problem of current-state opacity in discrete event systems (DESs) modeled in a labeled Petri Net (PN) framework and by observing its evolution. An observation of the system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder is unable to determine whether the current state of the system is within a set of secret states, otherwise it is said to be not current-state opaque. The proposed approach to verify the current-state opacity works on-line: the verification algorithm waits for the occurrence of an observable event and uses Integer Linear Programming problem solutions to verify if the behavior of the system is current-state opaque to the intruder under the given observation. Moreover, the proposed method is applied in two different settings: (i) a centralized approach where the intruder has full knowledge of the system model but can partially observe the system behavior; (ii) a decentralized approach where a set of intruders can observe different event sets and collaborate with a coordinator to disclose the same secret. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.}

The attacker can corrupt the sensor channels that transmit the sensor readings, making the operator incapable to establish when a critical marking is reached. We first construct the stealthy attack Petri net that keeps into account the real plant evolutions observed by the attacker and the corrupted plant evolutions observed by the operator. Starting from the reachability graph of the stealthy attack Petri net, an attack structure is defined: it describes all possible attacks. The supremal stealthy attack substructure can be obtained by appropriately trimming the attack structure. An attack function is effective if the supremal stealthy attack substructure contains a state whose first element is a critical marking and the second element is a noncritical marking.}

Originally designed to increase the productivity of ICS as well as safety and reliability, nowadays these systems are becoming the target of hackers. Several attacks highlighted vulnerabilities, the most relevant one, Stuxnet, stroke in 2010. Protection of ICS against cyberattacks has to be considered. Security of these systems is different from IT security solutions because exchanged data have physical consequences. For that, a new approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in ICS was presented based on filters monitoring orders and reports. Methodology to obtain these filters and their locations in the ICS architecture were introduced. In this paper, we present major improvements in detection mechanisms of these filters. Distance concept, introduced in previous paper (Sicard et al., 2017), is developed and combined to trajectory concept that allows filters to detect deviations from expected behavior. Distance from optimal or forbidden states is essential to compute order sequence bringing back the system into safe states. Trajectory, which is the evolution of distance during state evolution, improves detection mechanism by analyzing sequences sent to the system and received by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This combinational security prevents damages against goods and people. Implementation of time based intrusion detection is a step forward for improving filters. Temporal windows indicate when actions have to be done and if received reports correspond to executed orders. Thus, our filter approach secures ICS against combinational and temporal attacks affecting security of goods and people or quality.}

We consider two kinds of automata models: (i) acyclic automata, and (ii) automata where all cycles are only in the form of self-loops. In some sense, these models are the simplest models of (deadlock-free) systems. Although the expressivity of such systems is weaker than the expressivity of linear temporal logic, we show that the opacity verification for these systems is still hard.}

We address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete event systems (NDES). To this end, we propose an automaton model for NDES subject to DoS-D attacks that represents the adverse effects of DoS-D attacks on the observations of local diagnosers. We introduce a new codiagnosability definition called DoS-D-robust codiagnosability, and present a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be DoS-D-robustly codiagnosable.

In this context, a secret behavior is defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who partially observes the system’s evolution. A Petri net system is qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first search on a portion of the system’s execution.

In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system’s output behavior by inserting additional observable events. We define the property of “i-enforceability” that an insertion function needs to satisfy in order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion function’s ability to respond to every system’s observed behavior and to output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing a structure called the “All Insertion Structure” (AIS). The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.}

A system equipped with a dynamic mask, which acquires information dynamically by turning sensors on/off, is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all information acquired can never infer that the system was at some secret state for some specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem only consider current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for infinite-step opacity, a notion stronger than current-state opacity, is much more challenging. The main reason is that delayed information is involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret will be revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture all delayed information in the infinite-step opacity problem. An effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem. Our result extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity.}

We consider the problems of enforcing opacity under the assumption that the intruder either knows or does not know the structure of the insertion function; we term this requirement as public–private enforceability. The case of private enforceability alone, where the intruder does not know the form of the insertion function, is solved in our prior work. In this paper, we address the stronger requirement of public–private enforceability, that requires opacity be preserved even if the intruder knows or discovers the structure of the insertion function. We formulate the concept of public–private enforceability by defining the notion of public safety. This leads to the notion of public–private enforcing (PP-enforcing) insertion functions. We then identify a necessary and sufficient condition for an insertion function to be PP-enforcing. We further show that if opacity is privately enforceable by the insertion mechanism, then it is also public–private enforceable. Using these results, we present a new algorithm to synthesize PP-enforcing insertion functions by a greedy-maximal strategy. This algorithm is the first of its kind to guarantee opacity when insertion functions are made public or discovered by the intruder.}

abstract = {Due to the important application in security and safety analysis, fault prognosis of discrete event systems (DESs) plays a more vital role in study of Cyber–physical systems. In this work, we study the problem of decentralized fault prognosis in the context of partially-observed DESs. Different from existing results, we establish algebraic structures of given systems under decentralized agents by semi-tensor product rather than observers or verifiers based on formal language methods. The structure matrices of decentralized partially-observed DESs are polynomial in the size of a given system and linear about the number of agents. Besides, combining the formal method and algebraic state space approach, we discuss three kinds of coprognosability, called (M,K)-disjunctive-coprognosability aiming at disjunctive architectures, (M,K)-conjunctive-coprognosability for conjunctive architectures and (M,K)-strongly-coprognosability focusing on general structures, respectively. Here, (M,K) is the performance bound of a given prognostic system. In order to take both fault prediction and isolation into consideration, the decentralized prognoser is required to issue the “j” alarm for the jth type of fault and “0” means no fault alarm. Meanwhile, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to verify each kind of coprognosability based on the structure matrix approach and show that each verification is not separate.}

This paper considers the problem of intrusion detection and mitigation in supervisory control systems, where the attacker has the ability to enable or disable vulnerable actuator commands and erase or insert vulnerable sensor readings. We present a mathematical model for the system under certain classes of actuator enablement attacks, sensor erasure attacks, or sensor insertion attacks. We then propose a defense strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of unsafe system states. The technical condition of interest that is necessary and sufficient in this context, termed “GF-safe controllability”, is characterized. We show that the verification of GF-safe controllability can be performed using diagnoser or verifier automata. Finally, we illustrate the methodology with a traffic control system example.}

Given a discrete event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph, new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step opacity. The proposed approaches are shown to be more efficient than the standard methods based on the reachability graph.}

We present new algorithms for the verification of the properties of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity for partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as finite-state automata.

We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker’s point of view, and formulate an attack-with-bounded-sensor-reading-alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be computed, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which computes a supervisor that is ABSRA-robust in the sense that any ABSRA will either be detectable or inflict no damage to the system.}

We first introduce usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable events with at least a certain security level, and the highest usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES. Moreover, we extend the problem to the case of heterogeneous secrets with different levels of importance, and develop an algorithm to solve this extended problem.

Such a character can describe security problems in cyber-infrastructures, such as Internet and mobile communication networks or national defense service systems. This work presents a novel on-line methodology to verify the notion of initial-state opacity of discrete event systems that are modeled by labeled Petri nets. By working on-line, the intruder records an event and exploits integer linear programming problem for checking the initial-state opacity of the system’s evolution under the given observation.

There is a malicious intruder attempting to infer secrets of the system from its observations. To prevent the disclosure of secrets, the insertion function inserts fictitious events to the output of the system to obfuscate the intruder. The system is initialized with several types of resources, referred to as energy. The energy is consumed or replenished with event occurrences while always consumed with event insertions. The insertion function must enforce opacity while ensuring that each type of resource is never depleted. This problem is then reduced to a two-player game between the insertion function and the system (environment), with properly defined objectives. A game structure called the Energy Insertion Structure, denoted by EIS is proposed, which provably contains solutions to the energy constrained opacity enforcement problem. Then we further study the bounded cost rate insertion problem on the insertion function’s winning region of EIS, which requires that the long run average rate of insertion cost be bounded. This problem is formulated as a multidimensional mean payoff game and a special method called hyperplane separation technique is applied to efficiently solve it.}

ARP is a stateless protocol and any IP–MAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IP–MAC pairs. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks; however, these techniques either make IP–MAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc. In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not require any extra constraint like static IP–MAC, changing the ARP etc. A DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra ARP traffic by probing the source IP–MAC pair of only those ARP packets which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also, spoofed IP–MAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a test bed.}

Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for constructing local controllers that enforces opacity for each secret separately.}

Among many different notions of opacity, K-step opacity requires that the intruder can never determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret state for any specific instant within K steps prior to that particular instant. This notion becomes infinity-step opacity when K goes to infinity. Existing works on the analysis of infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a system is either opaque or non-opaque. To analyze infinite-step and K-step opacity more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity in the context of stochastic discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost infinite-step opacity (respectively, almost K-step opacity), is proposed to capture whether or not the probability of violating infinite-step opacity (respectively, K-step opacity) is smaller than a given threshold. We also provide effective algorithms for the verification of almost infinite-step opacity and almost K-step opacity.}

abstract = {A system is said to be opaque if an intruder that observes its evolution through a mask cannot infer that the system’s evolution belongs to a given secret behavior. Opacity verification is the problem of determining whether the system is opaque with respect to a given secret or not. In this paper we address the decidability of the opacity verification problem. Using reduction approaches, we show that verification of initial-state, current-state, and language opacity is undecidable in labeled Petri nets.}

abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the prominent network security attacks. In DDoS attack several machines send large amount of network traffic to the victim using spoofed IP address. Unfortunately there is no reliable technique to detect spoofed IP packets. In this paper we argue that, a proactive detection of spoofed IP packets will help in predicting DDoS attacks. In this paper we describe an event based detection method to identify spoofed IP packets. Our method works by proactively probing received packets for genuineness. Active probing technique uses inconsistencies in TTL values of received packets to decide whether the first packet was spoofed or genuine. We enumerate several possible spoofing scenarios with our detection method in place and identify its type based on the response to probing. Further, we study limitations of event based method and discuss ways to overcome those. We design and experiment with all spoofing scenarios in a real network setup and report the results. With few optimizations done to the probing strategy, the overhead incurred can be minimized considerably, which makes the proposed technique useful for detecting DDoS attacks.}

abstract = {In this paper, we formulate and analyze methodologies for verifying the notion of initial-state opacity in discrete event systems that are modeled as non-deterministic finite automata with partial observation on their transitions. A system is initial-state opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret states remains opaque (i.e., uncertain) to an intruder who observes system activity through some projection map. Initial-state opacity can be used to characterize security requirements in a variety of applications, including tracking problems in sensor networks. In order to model and analyze the intruder capabilities regarding initial-state opacity, we first address the initial-state estimation problem in a non-deterministic finite automaton via the construction of an initial-state estimator. We analyze the properties and complexity of the initial-state estimator, and show how the complexity of the verification method can be greatly reduced in the special case when the set of secret states is invariant. We also establish that the verification of initial-state opacity is a PSPACE-complete problem.}

abstract = {Opacity is a property of discrete event systems (DES) that is related to the possibility of hiding a secret to external observers (the intruders). The secret can be either a system state, or a sequence of events executed by the system itself. When the latter type of secrets is considered, the opacity property is referred to as language-based opacity (LBO). This paper deals with LBO when the DES is modeled by a labeled Petri net. One necessary and sufficient condition to check LBO by solving Integer Linear Programming problems is given; such a condition exploits the algebraic representation of Petri nets. A sufficient condition is then derived, which is less demanding from the computational point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown by means of examples.}

abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the performance safety enforcing problem in plants modeled by timed event graphs that are a subclass of timed Petri nets. We assume that a malicious intruder can increase the firing delay of transitions by adding delay in communication, or corrupt the transmitted data. Our target is to design a transition protecting policy to guarantee that the global performance does not drop below a given lower-bound threshold. Two classes of situations are considered: (1) the operator does not know the capability of the intruder, which means that all possible attacks must be taken into account; (2) the operator knows the upper bound of the capability of the intruder, e.g., the maximal number of transitions that can be simultaneously attacked. For the former case, we develop an algorithm using mixed integer linear programming to obtain an optimal protecting policy. For the latter situation, we develop a heuristic method to compute a protecting policy that is locally optimal.}
