abstract={This paper discusses how to use object-oriented technology and Petri nets for the modeling of military maneuver theory. Most military theories involve both concurrent processing units and discrete event systems. These can be best modeled with Petri nets. The maneuver theory includes preemption, dislocation, and disruption. Among them, dislocation plays a central role. The authors use Petri nets to model the dislocation strategy and, further, the combined-arms theory, which is an extension of the dislocation theory. Each attacking, moving, and defending unit is modeled as an object whose operation is represented as a subnet. Simulation can also be done with the appropriate integration of these Petri net submodels.},

abstract={The advent of modern computer technology has enabled the development of many complex man-made systems. These include discrete manufacturing systems, communication networks, computer systems, traffic control systems, and inventory systems. A common characteristic of these systems is that they have discrete states (e.g., idle, processing, queue empty/full, and normal/faulty). Also, their state transition is triggered by events (e.g., part arrival/dispatch, alarms, commands, and timeout). For this reason, these systems are called discrete event systems or event-driven systems. As today's industry moves towards more complex, distributed and heterogeneous discrete event systems, there is a growing need for integration, consolidation, correlation, and distribution of the events coming from the systems. Event correlation achieves those objectives using methods borrowed mostly from artificial intelligence and formal methods. Historically, event correlation systems were developed for real-time monitoring of many classical mission-critical systems such as power plant and water/gas/oil distribution systems. Recently, it has been spreading into new areas such as messaging, network management and computer intrusion detection.},

abstract={Crucial information systems and infrastructure are always under attack. Furthermore, the automation of individual exploits for computer security attack now raises the specter of large-scale attacks that will occur too quickly for human defenders to react. To counter these high-speed, automated attacks, Honeywell Laboratories is developing a unique computer defense system that automatically and adaptively responds to net intruders. The Cooperative Intelligent Real-Time Control Architecture for Dynamic Information Assurance (CIRCADIA) will provide local, low-cost, autonomic defenses for computing resources by intelligently adapting threat monitoring systems and automatically responding to security threats in real time. Most importantly, CIRCADIA will use control-theoretic methods to automatically synthesize its control strategies, rather than relying on hand-built rules or other knowledge. CIRCADIA is built on the foundation of the CIRCA architecture for intelligent realtime control systems. CIRCA automatically synthesizes and executes hard-real-time discrete event control systems for embedded applications. CIRCADIA can be thought of as a specialization of CIRCA, tailored to the computer security domain.},

abstract={Denial of service (DoS) attacks have become major threats to network security, which is pertinent to the deployment and performance of network-based control systems (NBCS). In this paper, we propose two queueing models to simulate the stochastic process of packet transmission under DoS attacks. The motivation is to quantitatively investigate how the attacks affect the performance of NBCS. The control system consists of a discrete PI controller (either event- or time-driven), a second-order plant, and two one-way delay vectors induced by networks. Experimental results indicate that the event-driven controller is more robust than the time-driven one under attacks. Model I DoS attacks (excessive packet loss) impair the performance, but do not destabilize the system with the event-driven controller. Model II DoS attacks (increased delay jitter) deteriorate the performance or even destabilize the system.},

abstract={When designers and developers create software they often overlook issues related to security. Ideally, protection of the program from illegal usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle. The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software development. Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible anomaly detection techniques which construct finite- state machine models of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g., system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.},

abstract={Motivated by security applications where the initial state of a system needs to be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (intruders), we formulate, analyze and verify the notion of initial-state opacity in discrete event systems. Specifically, a system is initial-state opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret states remains opaque to an intruder who is modeled as an observer of the system activity through some projection map. In other words, based on observations through this map, the observer is never certain that the initial state of the system is within the set of secret states. To verify initial-state opacity, we address the initial-state estimation problem in discrete event systems via the construction of an initial-state estimator. This estimator captures estimates of the initial state of the system which are consistent with all observations obtained so far. We also analyze the properties and complexity of the initial-state estimator.},

Specifically, a system is initial-state opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret states remains uncertain (opaque) to an outside intruder who observes system activity through a given projection map. In this paper, we consider the problem of constructing a minimally restrictive opacity-enforcing supervisor (MOES) which limits the system¿s behavior within some pre-specified legal behavior while enforcing the initial-state opacity requirement. To tackle this problem, we extend the state-based definition of initial-state opacity to languages and characterize the solution to MOES in terms of the supremal element of certain controllable, observable and opaque languages. We also derive conditions under which this supremal element exists and show how the initial-state estimator, which was introduced in our earlier work for verifying initial-state opacity, can be used to implement the solution to MOES.},

abstract={The performance of the Global Information Grid (GIG) and its heterogeneous network systems is a difficult problem facing GIG engineers in terms of characterizing end-to-end performance and defining service level agreements (SLA) between numbers of organizations. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Enterprise Wide Systems Engineering (EWSE) program management office, within Office of the Secretary of Defense - Network Networks and Information Integration (OSD-NII), is chartered to confront these issues. As the GIG continues to evolve in design and complexity, engineers will need to design robust end-to-end services and network/communications architectures to support the DoD and Intelligence communities. In order to attack these problems, the use of a modeling and simulation methodology (M&S) becomes a cost effective way to determine performance of complex system such as the GIG. The use of tools such as the Joint Communications Simulation System (JCSS) and OPNET Modeler are a few methods for studying the GIG from an end to end perspective to obtain performance metrics such that SLApsilas can be negotiated by DISA Enterprise Wide systems Engineering (EWSE) programs and its customers. Along with the M&S methodology, certain mathematical theories are employed to support these analyses. In this paper, Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is introduced and used in our analysis. EVT is commonly used in the IT industry to analyze the systempsilas performance, in particular the systempsilas robustness and scalability. The analysis employing the EVT is very helpful in identifying the problems generated by the system in extreme cases, therefore reducing the variable space required for discrete event simulations (DES).},

abstract={Motivated by security and privacy considerations in applications of discrete event systems, various notions of opacity have been introduced. Specifically, a system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder - at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This notion, which has been studied in non-deterministic finite automaton settings where the intruder observes a subset of events, has been shown to be useful in characterizing security requirements in many applications (including encryption using pseudo-random generators and trajectory coverage of a mobile agent in sensor networks). One limitation of these existing approaches is that they fail to provide a quantifiable measure for characterizing the degree of opacity of a given system. In this paper, we partially address this limitation by extending this framework to systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata, characterizing in the process the probability of observing a violation of current-state opacity. We introduce the notion of step-based almost current-state opacity which provides a measure of opacity for a given system. We also propose a verification method for this probabilistic notion of opacity and characterize its computational complexity.},

This reformulation also leads to a method that would be applicable to numerous real life signals that exist as discrete events, e.g., biological signals. Most importantly renewal theory allows us to characterize the performance of our detector and determine theoretical bounds on the time-to-detection. Compared to alternative methods that use frequency spectra or event arrival rates for detection our method is shown to be superior in terms of time-to-detection. Further, unlike rate based techniques, our method can estimate the multiple periods when multiple periodic anomalies occur simultaneously.},

abstract={A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software that monitors network activities and raises alerts on detection of malicious behavior. State-transition based framework like Finite State Machines (FSM), extended FSM, timed FSM, Discrete Event Systems (DES) etc. are widely used in network IDSs because the framework enables formal modeling, analysis, verification etc. The attack detection capability in these IDSs is based on passive monitoring of sequence of events with the assumption that intrusions lead to change in the sequence (which needs to be detected). However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive monitoring. In this paper we propose an IDS to detect ARP spoofing attacks using active state-transition framework called “active DES”.},

volume={},

pages={5D1-1-5D1-10},
abstract={The various fields of application for miniature air vehicles often do not provide distinct landing areas or even require additional equipment like nets or parachutes to land the aircraft without damaging it. This work introduces the deep stall landing (DSL) as a maneuver that uses the extraordinary aerodynamic characteristics of a delta wing MAV that come into effect after the angle of attack passes the stall angle. This landing maneuver is modeled based on a longitudinal aerodynamic model that takes lift, drag, thrust, weight, and pitching moment into account. By determining the operational modes that the aircraft has to perform in order to either complete the landing maneuver or abort it in case of a missed approach a hybrid system is identified. This system contains both continuous and discrete state dynamics that model the aircraft in each landing phase. Based on this hybrid system reachability analyses are performed which utilize level set methods to calculate backwards reachable sets. These sets are used to identify transitions within the modeled system that bring the aircraft form one operational mode to another without leaving the safe flight envelope. The final result is a discrete event system that covers all possible transitions within the refined model. Based on this discrete model an autonomous system can be implemented that is able to determine whether the initiation of the landing maneuver is safe in terms of keeping the aircraft within the safe flight envelope during the whole maneuver. Furthermore the results of the reachability analysis determine for which states of the aircraft it would be safe to initiate a recovery maneuver in case of a missed landing approach.},

abstract={A non-deterministic labeled finite automaton is initial-state opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret states S remains opaque (i.e., uncertain) to an intruder who observes system activity through some natural projection map. The verification of initial-state opacity has been shown to be a PSPACE-complete problem by establishing that it is equivalent to the language containment problem. In this paper we take a slightly different viewpoint and try to assess the ability of a user (who is dictating the activity in the system and indirectly the observations generated) to avoid revealing to the outside observer that the initial state of the system lied within the set of secret states S. A system that does not allow the user to act indefinitely in such a way is said to posses the property of resolution of initial state with respect to S. We show that in discrete event systems that can be modeled as non-deterministic labeled finite automata, this property can be verified with polynomial complexity in a way that resembles the verification of diagnosability.},

abstract={Opacity is a confidentiality property that arises in the analysis of security properties in networked systems. It characterizes whether a “secret” of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called an “intruder.” We consider the problem of enforcing opacity in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable strings. We define the property of “i-enforceability,” when there exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and construct a new structure called the “All Insertion Structure” (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.},

abstract={A system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an intruder-at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This notion of opacity has been studied in nondeterministic finite automata settings (where the intruder observes a subset of events, for example, via some natural projection mapping) and has been shown to be useful in characterizing security requirements in many applications (including encryption using pseudorandom generators and coverage properties in sensor networks). One limitation of the majority of existing analysis is that it fails to provide a quantifiable measure of opacity for a given system; instead, it simply provides a binary characterization of the system (being opaque or not opaque). In this paper, we address this limitation by extending current-state opacity formulations to systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata under partial observation. We introduce three notions of opacity, namely: 1) step-based almost current-state opacity; 2) almost current-state opacity; and 3) probabilistic current-state opacity, all of which can be used to provide a measure of a given system's opacity. We also propose verification methods for these probabilistic notions of opacity and characterize their corresponding computational complexities.},

abstract={The diagnosability condition for a Discrete Event System (DES) model requires that there exists no failureindeterminate cycles in the DES diagnoser for all failure types. This stringent requirement of DES diagnosability condition renders many systems non-diagnosable. I-diagnosability framework provides a weaker notion of diagnosability than DES diagnosability by considering only those failures that are followed by certain observable event(s) known as indicator events. However, some systems are I-non-diagnosable even in the presence of an indicator event following the failure event. In this paper, we propose I2-diagnosability framework overcomes the shortcomings of the I-diagnosability framework. In I2-DES framework an empowering event ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully. We have considered a practical example of Advanced Stealth Man in the Middle attack in Wi-Fi networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed I2-DES framework wherein the I-DES framework fails.},

abstract={Recently, online shopping integrating third-party payment platforms (TPPs) introduces new security challenges due to complex interactions between Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) of Merchants and TPPs. Malicious clients may exploit security vulnerabilities by calling APIs in an arbitrary order or playing various roles. To deal with the security issue in the early stages of system development, this paper presents a formal method for modeling and verification of online shopping business processes with malicious behavior patterns considered based on Petri nets. We propose a formal model called E-commerce Business Process Net to model a normal online shopping business process that represent intended functions, and malicious behavior patterns representing a potential attack that violates the security goals at the requirement analysis phase. Then, we synthesize the normal business process and malicious behavior patterns by an incremental modeling method. According to the synthetic model, we analyze whether an online shopping business process is resistant to the known malicious behavior patterns. As a result, our approach can make the software design provably secured from the malicious attacks at process design time and, thus, reduces the difficulty and cost of modification for imperfect systems at the release phase. We demonstrate our approach through a case study.},

abstract={In many emerging security applications, a system designer frequently needs to ensure that a certain property of a given system (that may reveal important details about the system's operation) be kept secret (opaque) to outside observers (eavesdroppers or intruders). Motivated by such applications, several researchers have formalized, analyzed, and described methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems of interest. This paper introduces and analyzes a notion of opacity in systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata or hidden Markov models. We consider a setting where a user needs to choose a specific hidden Markov model (HMM) out of m possible (different) HMMs, but would like to “hide” the true system from intruders, by not allowing them to have an arbitrary level certainty as to which system has been chosen. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions (that can be checked with polynomial complexity), under which the intruder cannot distinguish the true HMM, namely, the intruder cannot achieve a level of certainty about its decision that is above a certain threshold that we can a priori compute.},

abstract={In computer security, opacity is widely used and considered as a general language-theoretic scheme of many security properties of systems. A secret behaviour of a system is opaque if a passive attacker can never deduce its occurrence from the system observation. In [9], instead of considering the case of static observability where the set of observable events is fixed off-line or dynamic observability where the set of observable events changes over time depending on the history of the trace, we have introduced Orwellian partial observability where unobservable events are not revealed provided that downgrading events never occurs in the future of the trace. We show in the previous paper verifying opacity for regular secret is opaque for a regular language L w.r.t. an Orwellian projection is PSPACE-complete while it has been proved undecidable even for a regular language L w.r.t. a general Orwellian observation function. In this paper, we address two problems of opacification of a regular secret φ for a regular language L w.r.t. an Orwellian projection πo,d: Given L and a secret φ ∈ L, the first problem consists in computing some minimal regular super-language M of L, if it exists, such that φ is opaque for M w.r.t. πo,d and the second consists to compute the supremal sub-language M' of L such that φ is opaque for M' w.r.t. πo,d. We derive both language-theoretic characterizations and algorithms to solve the two problems.},

We consider specifications given as Interval Markov Chains (IMCs), which are underspecified Markov chains where probabilities on edges are only required to belong to intervals. Scheduling an IMC S produces a concrete implementation as a PTS and we define the worst case disclosure of secret φ in S as the maximal disclosure of φ over all PTSs thus produced. We compute this value for a subclass of IMCs and we prove that simulation between specifications can only improve the opacity of implementations.},

abstract={Unlike information, behaviors cannot be encrypted and may instead be protected by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from behaviors needed to be kept secret. Such a scheme may still leak information about secrets due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is a possible means of quantifying statistical difference between two distributions and was used to measure such information leak as in our earlier work [1]. This paper studies secrecy quantification in stochastic partially-observed discrete event systems in the presence of distributed collusive attackers/observers, each with its own local partial observability, generalizing the setting of single observer in [1]. The local observers collude and exchange their observations over communication channels that introduce bounded delays. We propose a method to compute the JSD-based secrecy measure in this distributed setting by introducing bounded-delay channel models to extend the system model to capture the effect of exchange of observations, and to measure the distributed secrecy loss.},

We present a mathematical model for the system under such actuator enablement attacks and propose a defense strategy that detects attacks online and disables all controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an algorithm for verifying whether the system can prevent damage from attacks with the proposed defense strategy, where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of “unsafe” states. The technical condition of interest that is necessary and sufficient in this context is characterized; it is termed “AE-safe controllability”.

In this work, we address the problem of enforcing current-state opacity by supervisory control. Given a system that is modeled with a finite automaton and that is not current-state opaque with respect to a given secret, the enforcement problem consists in designing a supervisor so that the controlled system is current-state opaque. We assume that the supervisor can only observe and control a subset of events. To be more general, we assume no specific containment relationship exists between the sets of events that can be observed by the intruder and the supervisor, respectively. We call this general setting uncomparable observations. We show that the maximally permissive supervisor always exists and propose a novel approach for its design.},

Our attack formulation is to identify a discrete event model of collected fault-free I/O traces from compromised PLCs, and find the undetectable false sequences that are selected as desired attacks injected into compromised sensors from the identified model.

abstract={While cryptography is used to protect the content of information (e.g., a message) by making it undecipherable, behaviors (as opposed to information) may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity (by providing covers that generate indistinguishable observations from secrets). Having a cover together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper, we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual information between the distributions over possible observations and that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation for the proposed measure is also presented. Illustrative examples, including the one with side-channel attack, are provided to demonstrate the proposed computation approach.},

title={Intrusion detection system for PS-Poll DoS attack in 802.11 networks using real time discrete event system},
year={2017},
volume={4},

pages={792-808},
abstract={Wi-Fi devices have limited battery life because of which conserving battery life is imperative. The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame(s) buffered by the access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping STA(s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame(s) to retrieve the buffered frame(s) of the sleeping STA(s) from the AP causing frame losses for the targeted STA(s). Current approaches to prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues. The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack. In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack scenarios.},

pages={730-745},
abstract={Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS) attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various attacks generated through custom scripts.},

abstract={One of the major challenges about cyber physical systems is how to prevent cyber attacks to ensure system integrity. There has been a large number of different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and computer science communities. In this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system in order to trick a given supervisor to issue control commands improperly, driving the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker point of view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata.},

abstract={We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the context of the supervisory control layer. Specifically, we propose a general model of a CPS attacker in the framework of Discrete Event Systems (DES) and investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given controlled system. Our model captures a class of deception attacks, where the attacker has the ability to modify a subset of sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an undesirable state. We introduce a new type of a bipartite transition structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA), to capture the game-like interaction between the supervisor and the environment (which includes the system and attacker). This structure is a discrete transition system that embeds information about all possible attacker's stealthy actions, and all states (some possibly unsafe) that become reachable as a result of those actions. We present a procedure for the construction of the IDA and discuss its properties. Based on the IDA, we discuss the characterization of successful stealthy attacks, i.e., attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the system.},

abstract={Opacity is an important information-flow property that arises in security and privacy analysis of cyber-physical systems. It captures the plausible deniability of the system's “secret” in the presence of a malicious intruder modeled as a passive observer. As a specific type of opacity, infinite-step opacity requires that the intruder can never determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret system for any specific instant in the past. Existing works on the analysis of infinite-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a system is either opaque or non-opaque. However, a non-infinite-step-opaque system may only have a small probability of violation; this may be still tolerable in many applications. To analyze infinite-step opacity more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate the verification of infinite-step opacity in the context of stochastic discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost infinite-step opacity, is proposed to capture whether or not the probability of violating infinite-step opacity is smaller than a given threshold. This notion is weaker than its purely logical counter-part as it takes the transition probability of the system into account. We also provide an effective algorithm for the verification of almost infinite-step opacity.},

A system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder, who only has partial observation on the system's evolution, is never able to establish if the current state of the system is within a set of secret states.

In particular, it is assumed that there are multiple intruders trying to determine if the current state is in the secret.

abstract={The problem of stealthy attacks for partially-observed discrete event systems is considered. An operator observes the plant through an observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted by an intruder who can insert and erase some sensor readings. We construct an attack structure A which guarantees that, when the plant reaches an unsafe state, A can make the operator think that the plant is in a safe state. Based on A, we can obtain a stealthy attack structure As by simply removing from A all the exposing states, all the weakly exposing states and their input and output arcs. The stealthy attack structure As only contains the possible attacks that can not be detected by the operator.},

We adopt the concept of an information-flow property called opacity to capture whether or not the networked supervisory control system is secure. Specifically, we say that the supervisory control system is opaque with insecure control channel if the intruder can never determine for sure that the system is in a secret state based on the control decisions sent by the supervisor.

This paper proposes a moving target defense system based on detection and prediction mechanism--DPDA system (detection-prediction-defense-assessment system), which utilizes the centralized control and programming flexibility of the SDN network. DPDA system is modeled as a discrete event dynamic system (DEDS), and performs detection of existing attacks based on real-time events. On the other hand, the attack probability transformation is used to adjust the transformation period based on the log-normal distribution function for unknown attacks. Finally, the simulation test environment is built. The results show that DPDA can implement more efficient active defense than the system with fixed transformation period.},

year={2019},
volume={6},

pages={789-806},
abstract={Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) facilitates reliable operation of systems. Various approaches have been proposed for FDD like Analytical redundancy (AR), Principal component analysis (PCA), Discrete event system (DES) model etc., in the literature. Performance of FDD schemes greatly depends on accuracy of the sensors which measure the system parameters. Due to various reasons like faults, communication errors etc., sensors may occasionally miss or report erroneous values of some system parameters to FDD engine, resulting in measurement inconsistency of these parameters. Schemes like AR, PCA etc., have mechanisms to handle measurement inconsistency, however, they are computationally heavy. DES based FDD techniques are widely used because of computational simplicity, but they cannot handle measurement inconsistency efficiently. Existing DES based schemes do not use Measurement inconsistent (MI) parameters for FDD. These parameters are not permanently unmeasurable or erroneous, so ignoring them may lead to weak diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a Measurement inconsistent discrete event system (MIDES) framework, which uses MI parameters for FDD at the instances they are measured by the sensors. Otherwise, when they are unmeasurable or erroneously reported, the MIDES invokes an estimator diagnoser that predicts the state(s) the system is expected to be in, using the subsequent parameters measured by the other sensors. The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated using a pumpvalve system. In addition, an MIDES based intrusion detection system has been developed for detection of rogue dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) server attack by mapping the attack to a fault in the DES framework.},

abstract={This note investigates enforcement of opacity by nondeterministic edit functions. The edit functions alter the system's output by inserting fictitious events or erasing observed events. The edit decisions are randomly made while not known by the outside environment a priori. There is an intruder characterized as a passive observer with malicious goals to infer the secrets of the system. We require that opacity be enforced when the intruder may or may not know the implementation of edit functions. This requirement is termed as private and public safety. We also restrict the operation of edit functions by defining edit constraints. Then, the opacity enforcement problem is transformed to a three-player game among the edit function, the environment, and a dummy player, which helps to determine edit decisions. A game structure called the all edit structure (AES) is introduced to characterize the interaction among those players. It embeds all privately safe edit functions and may also embed publicly safe edit functions. Based on the AES, we present an algorithm that provably synthesizes nondeterministic edit functions that satisfy both private safety and public safety.},

abstract={Wi-Fi technology has seen rapid growth in the last two decades. It has revolutionized the way we access the Internet. However, they are vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack, the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin attacks in a Wi-Fi network.},

For this purpose, first, we classify the current research works under a framework consisting of three dimensions: 1) the communication channel where an attack can happen, 2) the attack impact on the transmitted data, and 3) the mechanism to prevent damage. This classification will then help us to compare the existing techniques and investigate how they can be improved to get closer to the ideal scenario where most kinds of attacks can be handled so that the closed-loop system remains safe.},

abstract={The reliance of many emerging applications on shared cyber-infrastructures has prompted the study of various notions for security and privacy, including notions for deterministic, non-deterministic, and probabilistic systems. The main contribution of this work is to extend these ideas to timed stochastic systems, by introducing and analyzing opacity exposure as a measure of vulnerability to security violations. More specifically, we consider partially observed stochastic Petri net (POSPN) models that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., the time delays of all events are independent random variables and have exponential probability density functions). We assume that certain events and part of the marking trajectories are observable to an outside observer (intruder) who is interested in determining whether current-state opacity is violated (i.e., whether the intruder can infer with certainty that the marking of the system necessarily lies within a given secret set of states). In a timed system, as the POSPN considered in this paper, we are also interested in knowing how much time the intruder has to react in case current-state opacity is violated. We consider and analyze two critical aspects: (i) the frequency with which the system enters a time interval where an opacity violation occurs, and (ii) the amount of time the intruder has to take any malicious action.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose and address the problem of supervisor obfuscation against actuator enablement attack, in a common setting where the actuator attacker can eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We propose a method to obfuscate an (insecure) supervisor to make it resilient against actuator enablement attack in such a way that the behavior of the original closed-loop system is preserved. An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under controllability and observability constraints, which can be tackled by using SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors.},

In this paper, a controller encryption scheme for discrete event systems is presented that secures the communication and the information inside the controller.

The homomorphic encryption scheme allows the evaluation of encrypted data without additional decryption and encryption steps. Thus the controller can be evaluated completely in the encrypted domain.

Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the controller. In this work, we consider that such communication is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state. We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. The solution methodology that we develop uses techniques from the area of stochastic graph-games, specifically turn-based one-player stochastic reachability games.},

abstract={Opacity of discrete event systems (DESs) has been well investigated in recent years. However, all the existing researches only focus on crisp models. Note that a lot of practical systems are filled with uncertainties that cannot be accurately characterized by crisp models but can be well handled by fuzzy models. Therefore, the researches of opacity of DESs should be extended to fuzzy models. In this paper, we investigate the opacity of fuzzy DESs, in which both system behaviors and secrets are fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets, and intruders make inferences by means of fuzzy logic instead of classic logic.},

title={Rogue Twin Attack Detection: A Discrete Event System Paradigm Approach},
year={2019},
volume={},
number={},
pages={1813-1818},
abstract={Rogue Twin Access Point (AP) is a rogue Wi-Fi hotspot/AP setup by an adversary solely with the purpose of luring Wi-Fi stations (STAs) into connecting to them. An adversary clones the Service Set IDentifier (SSID) [Hotspot Name] as well as the MAC address of the legitimate AP while setting up the rogue twin. When a STA checks for the list of available APs (under presence of rogue twin), it sees only one AP (despite there being two APs with the identical SSID and MAC address). In case the signal strength of the rogue twin is more than the legitimate AP, the STA connects to the rogue twin.In the present study, a Discrete Event System (DES) paradigm based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting rogue twin which is proposed. It overcomes many drawbacks of existing approaches in tackling rogue twin. A normal DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under normal network conditions along with a failure (attacker) DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under rogue twin network conditions is constructed. Using the knowledge of the normal and attacker DES models, a DES diagnoser is constructed to ascertain whether the frame exchange corresponds to a normal or attack condition. Even if an attacker uses multiple techniques to launch the rogue twin the proposed DES based IDS is capable of identifying all such possible instances. We validate the scheme on a real test bed.},

abstract={The reliance of many emerging applications on shared cyber-infrastructures has prompted the study of various notions for security and privacy, including notions for deterministic, non-deterministic, and probabilistic systems. The main contribution of this work is to extend these ideas to timed stochastic systems, by introducing and analyzing timing aspects of initial-state opacity, as measures of vulnerability to security violations. More specifically, we consider partially observed stochastic Petri net (POSPN) models that behave according to Markovian dynamics. We assume that certain events are observable to an outside observer (intruder) and we are interested in initial-state opacity, i.e., determining whether an intruder can infer that the initial marking of the system necessarily lies within a given secret set of initial states. In case initial-state opacity is violated for some behavior in the system, we are also interested in knowing how much time the system remains safe before this violation occurs.},

abstract={Over the last year, the Internet of Things (IoT) drove the development of cyber-physical systems, leading the convergence between information and operational technologies. This coupling improves performances and saves costs but increases the number of vulnerabilities and the attack surface to malicious actors. Consequently, it is mandatory to understand how IoT devices can be properly integrated into a more secure environment. This issue is even more crucial in the field of Critical Infrastructures, such as energy, water, transportation, and telecommunications. To this aim, this paper analyzes the concept of opacity for Discrete Event Systems (DES) and applies it to a real system. The opacity describes the ability of the system to keep some states secret even if an attacker knows the happening of some events. The proposed approach is validated by applying the concept of opacity on the analysis over a simple system. It is demonstrated that opacity can be guaranteed and exploited when systems having different levels of security are integrated.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a key technology in the development of distributed and autonomous large scale systems. However, one of their undesirable side effects is the fact that they are particularly exposed to cyber attacks carried out by malicious intruders. Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the plant under attack.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of physical processes that are controlled or monitored by software and communication capabilities. Sensors and actuators are elements of CPS that can be vulnerable to attacks. Sensor attacks typically consist in corrupting or hiding information received from sensors, or creating nonexisting information. Actuator attacks typically consist in intercepting and modifying orders sent to actuators. Attacks may lead to serious situations that we will call failures. We adopt a discrete event system (DES) approach, where information received from sensors and actions realized by actuators are represented as discrete events. We first develop a model of the attacked system using supervisory control of DES. Then, we study the defense viewpoint, where we develop methods to detect attacks and avoid failures, and determine conditions of attack detectability and failure avoidability. Then, we study the attacker's viewpoint, where we develop a strategy based on supervisory control of DES to make the attacker undetectable.},

pages={154-161},
abstract={One of alternative ways to achieve a competitive advantage by an enterprise in the ICT area is to select the most prospective information system (IS) as a seed technology. The latter is defined as a first technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs, taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended variant of the above application may also provide decision support to developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply the best-possible technology development and market strategies.},

abstract={In this work, we study supervisory control of discrete event systems in the presence of network-based attacks on information delivered to and from the supervisors. The attacks are modeled by finite state transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible attack behavior is the desired one - we refer to such supervisors as attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the design algorithm for an attack-resilient supervisor, in scenarios where no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it. Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a desired language is controllable with intermittently secure communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate our approach on several examples.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the security issue in networked supervisory control systems over multiple channel networks. We consider a networked discrete-event system controlled by a supervisor that receives information from sensors and sends control decisions to actuators via observations channels and control channels, respectively. The security problem is studied for the scenario where some of the communication channels are insecure in the sense there exists a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that can access the information-flow in those insecure communication channels. We adopt the concept of opacity, an information flow security property, to characterize the security status of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that system has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder can never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the information-flow in the insecure channels. A new network observer is proposed to estimate the state of the system with two-side incomparable channel information. We show that the opacity verification problem for the networked setting can be effectively solved using the proposed network observer.},

year={2020},
volume={65},
number={4},
pages={1429-1441},
abstract={We investigate the problem of synthesizing dynamic masks that preserve the infinite-step opacity in the context of discrete-event systems. Dynamic mask is an information acquisition mechanism that controls the observability of the system's events dynamically online, e.g., by turning sensors on/off. A system equipped with a dynamic mask is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all acquired information can never infer that the system was at some secret state for any specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem can only preserve the current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for the infinite-step opacity, which is stronger than the current-state opacity, is much more challenging. The main reason is that the delayed information is involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret can be revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture all the delayed information in the infinite-step opacity synthesis problem. An effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem, which extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from the current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity. Additionally, an information-state-reduction-based approach is proposed to further mitigate the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure. Finally, we discuss how to generalize our results to a class properties with delayed information including infinite-step K-anonymity and infinite-step indistinguishability.},

abstract={Opacity, a confidentiality property, is an increasing concern in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that are vulnerable to an intruder which intends to reveal a “secret” of a system. This note presents a new framework for opacity and considers the problem of enforcing opacity in CPSs modeled as linear time-invariant systems. The confidential information involves the CPS' interference attenuation capacity (IAC), called the secret. A system is opaque if the intruder never infers the secret IAC from an observation mapping of system output. To guarantee the confidentiality requirement, an effective algorithm is proposed for synthesizing opacity-enforcing controllers by using a new approximation-based Q-learning. A main advantage of this method is that it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics matrices. A simulation example is presented to sustain the theoretical results.},

abstract={This article develops a novel compositional and abstraction-based approach to synthesize edit functions for opacity enforcement in modular discrete event systems. Edit functions alter the output of the system by erasing or inserting events in order to obfuscate the outside intruder, whose goal is to infer the secrets of the system from its observation. We synthesize edit functions to solve the opacity enforcement problem in a modular setting, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared with the monolithic approach. Two abstraction methods called opaque observation equivalence and opaque bisimulation are first employed to abstract the individual components of the modular system and their observers. Subsequently, we propose a method to transform the synthesis of edit functions to the calculation of modular supremal nonblocking supervisors. We show that the edit functions synthesized in this manner correctly solve the opacity enforcement problem.},

abstract={The less conservative co-design problem of dual security control and communication for CPS was studied for a class of nonlinear CPS with an actuator fault and DoS attack based on the DETCS. First, combining with the edge computing thought, data filtering and partial computing tasks were assigned to the network edge devices. The DoS attack with limited energy is converted into a special time delay; thus, the discrete event trigger condition, the actuator fault estimation and regulation, and the robustness for DoS attack can be considered uniformly. A dual security control framework of non-uniformly sampled data system was proposed under the DETCS for CPS, and the T-S fuzzy model of closed-loop nonlinear CPS with the co-existence of fault and attack was established. Second, with the help of time-delay system theory, a robust observer for state and fault estimation and the co-design method of dual security control and communication with the actuator fault and DoS attack were obtained by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and using affine Bessel-Legendre inequality. Finally, the validity and feasibility of the theoretical results were verified by a classical quadruple-tank system.},

abstract={Initial-state estimation consists in determining the initial state of the system based on the observation from the system and the system structure. It is the basis for many problems in security applications, such as opacity, detectability and supervisory control. However, when it comes to cyber-physical systems (CPS) communication delays and losses are inevitable. In this letter, we study the initial-state estimation problem in a CPS that is modeled with a multi-channel networked discrete event system (NDES). In practice, the system is usually distributed over several locations, and the communication between the system and an agent (e.g., intruder, observer, supervisor) is carried out via a shared network, in which communication delays and losses may happen. In multi-channel NDESs, even when the first-in first-out rule is satisfied in each channel, the order of events received by the agent may still be shuffled due to random communication delays in each channel. To address these new challenges, we formalize the initial-state estimation problem in multi-channel NDESs and a networked initial-state estimator is proposed to generate the exact initial-state estimate.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of synthesizing maximally-permissive opacity-enforcing supervisors for partially-observed discrete-event systems. We focus on a specific type of opacity called infinite-step opacity requiring that the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never determine for sure that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific instant. When the original system is verified to be non-opaque, one is interested in synthesizing a supervisor that controls the system in a least-restrictive manner such that the closed-loop system is opaque. We provide an effective approach for solving the infinite-step opacity control problem by re-formulating this problem as a two-player game over a generalized information structure that involves information delays. We show that the proposed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and the resulting supervisor is maximally-permissive. Most of the existing works on opacity-enforcing supervisory control only consider current-state opacity in which no delayed information is involved. Our work provides a complete solution to the infinite-step opacity control problem without any assumption on the relationship between controllable events and observable events.},

abstract={Cyber-physical systems have been highly integrated into many contemporary infrastructures. As this integration deepens, the importance of protecting these systems from unauthorized access and data corruption increases. Nowadays, cyber-physical systems are not well protected against network attacks. One solution is to improve the security of a system by encrypting the transmitted data. In this paper, we consider the encryption of supervisors of discrete event systems modeled with deterministic finite-state automata. We propose an encryption framework of supervisory control systems based on the matrix notation of automata. The purpose of using matrix notation is to make it suitable for homomorphic encryption schemes over integers, which are emerging in the cryptography area. We calculate the entropy of the matrix notation and find that as the size of a system increases, it gets smaller and approaches zero. Owing to the low entropy of the matrix notation, we propose an algorithm to enhance its entropy. By applying the entropy-enhancing process, the distribution characteristics of entries in matrices or vectors can be hidden to avoid a brute force attack. Correspondingly, we propose an entropy restoration algorithm to ensure that the control action can be transmitted correctly.},

pages={4504-4510},
abstract={This paper investigates attack mitigation problem in supervisory control of discrete event systems. We consider the scenario where the system is subject to actuator enablement attack. We explicitly distinguish between controllable events and defendable events; the former are events that can be disabled by the normal supervisor but may be subject to attack, while the latter are events that can be defensed (disabled definitely) by the mitigation module but possibly with higher costs. The objective is to design an attack mitigation strategy to prevent serious damage from attack. We formulate the attack mitigation problem as a tolerant control problem under partial observation. Particularly, in addition to guarantee safety, we aim to maximize the desirable behavior (normal specification) while minimize the tolerable behavior (safe but not desirable). We provide an effective online algorithm for solving this problem, which yields a novel attack mitigation strategy that generalizes the existing one in the literature. Specifically, we show that the proposed strategy may still prevent damage even when the safe-controllability condition, which is required by the existing strategy, does not hold.},

pages={1-6},
abstract={6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6 connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the butter, which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic solutions and split butter approaches to intelligently guarantee butter reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before. We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared to the state of the art solutions.},

abstract={Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents a backbone of modern reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), which enable manufacturing of a high product variety through rapid and easy reconfiguration of manufacturing equipment. In IIoT-enabled RMS, modular equipment is built from smart devices, each performing its own tasks, whereas the global functioning is achieved through their networking and intensive communication. Although device communication contributes to the system reconfigurability, it also opens up new security challenges due to potential vulnerability of communication links. In this article, we present security analysis for a major part of RMS in which manufacturing equipment is sequentially controlled and can be modeled as discrete event systems (DES). Control distribution within DES implies communication of certain events between smart modules. Specifically, in this work, we focus on attacks on communication of these events. In particular, we develop a method for modeling such attacks, including event insertion and removal attacks, in distributed sequential control; the method is based on the supervisory control theory framework. We show how the modeled attacks can be detected and provide a method for identification of communication links that require protection to avoid catastrophic damage of the system. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally validate applicability of our methodology on a real-world industrial case study with reconfigurable manufacturing equipment.},

abstract={Opacity, as an important security property, has been well investigated in crisp discrete event systems. However, in some practical systems, the general behaviors, secret and nonsecret behaviors obtained by the intruder need to be expressed as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets. Under this situation, the intruder makes inferences by fuzzy logic rather than classic logic, thus the notions of the fuzzy opacity measures are desired to be established. First, by means of the basic laws of fuzzy logic, a general fuzzy opacity measure, as a template, is presented, in this article, for the given generalized characterizations of secret and nonsecret behaviors. Moreover, a specific measure, called as fuzzy initial-final opacity (FIFO) measure, is investigated under the assumption that the secrets and nonsecrets can be coded into the initial-final state-pairs. In addition, two variants of FIFO measure are also proposed under the assumptions that the secrets and nonsecrets are only related to the initial-states or final-states. With these fuzzy opacity measures, the system designers can evaluate the opacity degree of the systems to be designed. To show the applicability of the fuzzy opacity measures to practical systems, we finally present an illustrative example of evaluating the location privacy protection systems in location-based services by means of the fuzzy opacity measures.},

abstract={Non-interference in discrete event systems deals with the possibility by an intruder to infer the occurrences of private and non observable events, the so called high-level ones, by interacting with the system at a user level, i.e., by observing the occurrence of the so called low-level ones. When bisimulation non-interference is considered, the security objective is not only to avoid the detection of high-level event occurrences, but also to avoid the detection of their non occurrences; i.e., the secret includes also the non occurrences of some events. This letter deals with such a more restrictive security property in the framework of discrete event systems modelled as Petri nets. A necessary and sufficient condition is given to assess bisimulation non-interference in bounded Petri nets. Such a condition requires the solution of integer linear programming optimization problems, whose solution can be used also to statically enforce bisimulation non-interference when this condition is not satisfied by the original system.},

abstract={Opacity is a security notion that focuses on determining whether a given system's behavior is kept secret to intruders. Various notions of opacity have received significant attention during the last decade including current state opacity and initial state opacity, which have been studied for deterministic and probabilistic systems in untimed contexts. In timed systems, opacity requirements may vary with time and one could also be interested in knowing the time duration for which opacity requirements are violated or preserved. The main contribution of this article is to introduce and analyze opacity exposure and opacity revelation times as measures of vulnerability in timed discrete event system (DES) that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., at any given time, all enabled events are independent and distributed in time with exponential probability density functions). Labeled stochastic Petri nets (LSPNs) are used to model timed stochastic DESs, and appropriate constructions (involving current and initial state observers) are used to evaluate exposure and revelation times for a given LSPN.},

abstract={In this article, we investigate security and privacy issues in networked supervisory control systems over multiple channel networks. We consider a networked discrete-event system controlled by a supervisor that receives information from sensors and sends control decisions to actuators via observation channels and control channels, respectively. The security problem is studied for the scenario where some of the communication channels are insecure in the sense there exists a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that can access the information-flow in those insecure communication channels. We adopt the concept of opacity, an information flow security property, to characterize the security status of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that the system has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder can never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the information-flow in the insecure channels. We consider the notions of current-state opacity, K-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity in the networked control setting. New network observers are proposed to estimate the state of the system with two-side incomparable channel information. We show that the opacity verification problems for the networked setting can be effectively solved using the proposed network observers.},

We define two bounds on languages, an upper-bound and a lower-bound, to describe the nondeterministic behavior.

The design objective is to synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even when the control policy is publicly known. In this paper, we propose a new approach for enforcing opacity using non-deterministic supervisors. A non-deterministic supervisor is a decision mechanism that provides a set of control decisions at each instant, and randomly picks a specific control decision from the decision set to actually control the plant. Compared with the standard deterministic control mechanism, such a non-deterministic control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision is a random realization and cannot be implicitly inferred from the control policy. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for synthesizing a non-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. Furthermore, we show that non-deterministic supervisors},

abstract={The problem of state estimation in the setting of partially-observed discrete event systems subject to cyber attacks is considered. An operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator. An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which the attacker may insert at most $n$ events between two consecutive observations.},

abstract={This paper deals with decentralized fault diagnosis for a discrete-event system that is observed at multiple observation sites through communication channels that can be attacked. The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker, assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and results in a "local" symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e., only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a certain total cost.},

abstract={Recently, the problem of model-based synthesis of covert attackers has received a lot of attention in the discrete event systems literature. However, all the existing works assume the model of the supervisor to be available (to the adversary) for the synthesis to be effective, which can be unrealistic in practice. In this work, we consider a much more challenging, but more practical, setup where the model of the supervisor is in general not available. To compensate this lack of knowledge, we assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem over certain surrogate plant. Due to the over-approximation involved in the surrogate plant, the heuristic is provably sound, but in general it is not complete. For simplicity, in this paper we only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks.},

abstract={Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an IETF-standardized web transfer protocol, is specially designed to facilitate resource-constrained devices and low power, lossy networks. The steep rise in extensive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, of late, makes it necessary for web services to be used over the internet by constrained wireless nodes for a majority of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications. However, considering that the system is constrained, ensuring security is a challenge when employing CoAP since it uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is unrealiable and lacks handshaking mechanism. A malicious endpoint with read and write access can severly jeopardize service availability by launching an IP address spoofed attack. Moreover, it can help mount other complex Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks like amplification attacks. Though response spoofing vulnerability has been addressed in the research community for quite some time now, request spoofing countermeasures are relatively few. In this paper, we propose an attacker identification scheme using a Discrete Event System (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Through our scheme, we not only detect request and response spoofing attack in CoAP, but also identify the adversarial node by analysing the LoWPAN event dynamics generated due to probe responses. Correctness of our approach is guaranteed by construction of a DES diagnoser. We have tested our approach on Contiki OS. The experimental results show our proposed scheme to be energy efficient with response time of approx 6 sec at 99.2% accuracy.},

abstract={Manufacturing systems may be subject to external attacks and failures, so it is important to deal with the recovery of the system after these situations. This article deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT. The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners—Given the unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state, recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs), introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).},

abstract={Opacity is an important security notion for discrete event systems (DESs) to measure the secret behaviors leaked to an intruder. The intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs, called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services.},

In this article, we consider the supervisory control layer of CPSs, focusing on closed-loop control systems vulnerable to sensor-reading modification attacks (SM-attacks), which may disguise the occurrence of an event as a different event by modifying appropriately sensor readings in sensor communication channels. In particular, we consider the plant modeled as a bounded Petri net and the control specification consisting in liveness enforcing. Based on repeatedly computing a more restrictive liveness-enforcing supervisor under no attack and constructing a so-called basic supervisor, a method that synthesizes a liveness-enforcing supervisor tolerant to an SM-attack is proposed.},

abstract={This article addresses the robust control problem of discrete event systems assuming that replacement attacks may occur, thus making it appear that an event that has occurred looks like another event. In particular, we assume that this is done by tampering with the sensor-readings in the sensor communication channel. Specifically, we use Petri nets as the reference formalism to model the plant and assume a control specification in terms of a generalized mutual exclusion constraint. We propose three different methods to derive a control policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems. On the contrary, the third method computes a policy more efficiently and reveals more easily implementable in practice. However, this is done at the expense of optimality.},

pages={2030-2041},
abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we propose an algorithm to verify this property. <italic>Note to Practitioners</italic>&#x2014;CPSs form the basis for the fourth industrial revolution, called Industry 4.0. In these kinds of systems, communication networks are used to connect sensors, actuators, and controllers in the closed-loop system. The increase in the use of communication networks also increases the vulnerability of CPSs to cyberattacks. The use of conventional defenses, such as firewalls, is not recommended in industrial systems due to the introduction of communication delays. In this article, we propose a new defense strategy that prevents damages in the system caused by man-in-the-middle attacks. A security supervisor is proposed to disable controllable events when there is a risk to reach states of the system that may represent damages to the system or its operators.},

abstract={In this letter, we consider the problem of verifying initial-state opacity for networks of discrete-time control systems. We formulate the opacity property as a safety one over an appropriately constructed augmented system, and aim to verify this latter property by finding suitable barrier certificates. To reduce the computational complexity associated with computing barrier certificates for large networks, we propose a compositional approach to construct such barrier certificates for large-scale interconnected systems. This is achieved by introducing local barrier certificates for subsystems in the network and imposing some small-gain type conditions on the gains of those local barrier certificates. We also provide sufficient conditions for verifying the lack of opacity in large-scale networks by constructing barrier certificates ensuring some reachability properties over the augmented systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of our results, we consider the problem of tracking a target using a team of vehicles and verify if its initial position is secret from possible outside intruders.},

abstract={In this article, we study the security of control systems in the context of the supervisory control layer of stochastic discrete-event systems. Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the controller. In this article, we consider that such communication is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state. We consider this problem from the attacker&#x2019;s viewpoint and investigate the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function, i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple objectives. Our solution methodology is based on mapping these problems to optimal control problems for Markov decision processes, specifically, a probabilistic reachability problem and a stochastic shortest path problem.},

abstract={The development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has brought much attention of researchers to cyber-attack and cyber-security. A sensor attacker targeting on a supervised discrete event system can modify a set of sensor readings and cause the closed-loop system to reach undesirable states. In this letter, we propose a new attack detection mechanism under which the supervisor only needs to keep track of the last observable event received. Given a plant and a supervisor enforcing a state specification, we define a sensor attacker <italic>threatening</italic> if it may cause the closed-loop system to enter a forbidden state. Our goal is to verify whether there exists such a threatening sensor attacker for a given controlled system. A new structure, called All Sensor Attack (ASA), is proposed to capture all possible sensor attacks launched by the attacker. Based on the ASA automaton, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a stealthy threatening sensor attacker is presented. Finally, we show that the condition can be verified in polynomial time.},

abstract={Given a discrete event system, it is said to be opaque if an intruder who can partially observe system behavior cannot infer that the system is necessarily in a predefined secret. A discrete event system is current-state opaque if an intruder is never able to verify whether the current state of the system is within the secret states. This article addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable transitions and propose an approach for the verification of current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets. It is shown by experimental studies that the symbolic approach is practically more efficient than traditional techniques such as basis reachability graphs (BRGs).},

year={2022},
volume={6},
number={},
pages={2948-2953},
abstract={In this letter, we investigate how to make use of model reduction techniques to identify the vulnerability of a closed-loop system, consisting of a plant and a supervisor, that might invite attacks. Here, the system vulnerability refers to the existence of key observation sequences that could be exploited by a specific smart sensor attack to cause damage infliction. We consider a nondeterministic smart attack, i.e., there might exist more than one attack choice over each received observation, and adopt our previously proposed modeling framework, where such an attack is captured by a standard finite-state automaton. For a given supervisor S and a smart sensor attack model A, another smart attack model <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${\mathrm{ A}}'$ </tex-math></inline-formula> is called attack equivalent to A with respect to S, if the resulting compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of the supervisor S and attack model <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${\mathrm{ A}}'$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, is control equivalent to the original compromised supervisor, defined as the composition of S and A. Following the spirit of supervisor reduction that relies on the concept of control congruence, we will show that, this problem of synthesizing a reduced smart attack model <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">${\mathrm{ A}}'$ </tex-math></inline-formula> that is attack equivalent to A with respect to S, can be transformed to a classical supervisor reduction problem, making all existing synthesis tools available for supervisor reduction directly applicable to our problem. A simplified and ideally minimum-state attack model can reveal all necessary observation sequences for the attacker to be successful, thus, reminds system designers to take necessary precautions in advance, which may improve system resilience significantly. An example is presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed attack model reduction technique.},

abstract={In this letter we study a resilient supervisory control design problem in discrete-event systems. Consider that there are certain unsafe states in the system that must be prevented from entering, and this can be ensured by a supervisor disabling certain controllable events. Also consider that the system is subject to actuator attacks from intruders: some controllable events disabled by a supervisor may be re-enabled by an intruder. Our purpose is to address a challenging scenario where the controllable events that are vulnerable to attacks are <italic>indefinite</italic>, i.e., any controllable event can be attacked. Associating to each unsafe state with a required <italic>safety level</italic> (a positive integer), our aim of this letter is to design a resilient supervisor such that for every unsafe state <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, if the number of actuator attacks is no greater than the safety level of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>, then the controlled system is guaranteed to avoid entering <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$q$ </tex-math></inline-formula>. We first encode the behavior of the system under attack into an automaton called the <italic>resiliency automaton</italic>. We then show that the resilient supervisor synthesis problem may be cast into a supervisory control problem in the resiliency automaton. Hence, a maximally permissive resilient supervisor can be obtained by using the Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on supervisory control design against indefinite actuator attacks in discrete-event systems.},

Given a critical system that may leak confidential information, an attacker and a subset of controllable actions, we propose an approach to synthesize a controller that enforces the system&#x0027;s opacity. This controller is designed as a function that applies, at run time, on the current executions to disable any controllable action that eventually leads to the violation of the system&#x0027;s opacity.

abstract={Unsupervised learning is used for analysing and clustering data when the expected cluster or class labels are not available, i.e., we are not aware of the type of information to be found. When we know only a little about the data labels, it is still challenging to make conclusions out of the data, although this may be the case for many real world data mining problems. We name the type of learning algorithms useful in this scenario as Near Unsupervised Learning (NUL). My group has been developing NUL algorithms based on the previous ly proposed Growing Self Organising Maps. The concept and the algorithm development in NUL and the application in various biological data mining problems will be discussed. Some “unusual” features and signatures captured by my team will also be presented. Real problems attempted using NUL includes the following: 1) Metagenomics involves the challenging problem of clustering and eventually labelling genomic data of microbial species that cannot be easily grown in laboratories. We only know about 2% of these species found on Earth. Could this be the life form we expect to find on another planet? How do we understand and use some unique characteristics of microbes living in our environment and our body? 2) Analysing metabolite profiles of various wheat plants to understand how some type of the plants can survive droughts is an area where NUL can provide good solutions, 3) Can we analyse signals coming from biological neural networks grown on wet labs to differentiate the sick brain tissues from healthy ones? Our collaborating researchers create mice with genetics based brain diseases and analyse the brain tissues wi th and without the introduction of drugs. Which drugs (for example drugs preventing epileptic attacks) are more effective on a particular type of sickness?},

abstract={Fragility and resiliency have emerged as important research topics in the control of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), especially when the associated sensors and actuators may be compromised by malicious attackers. These problems have received increasing attention in the area of discrete event systems, where discrete abstractions of CPS are used to study resilient state estimation and supervisory control. A Call for Papers for this Special Section was issued in the fall of 2021, with a submission deadline of January 20, 2022. The submissions received were reviewed and revised according to the policies and timelines of L-CSS. Five Guest Associate Editors were invited to handle the submissions:},
