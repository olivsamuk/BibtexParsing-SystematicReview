Abstract = {The constituent controllers in a supervisory control system may
   sometimes fail as a result of an intruder interfering with the feedback
   performance of the system. The intrusion may allow the system to execute
   traces that the supervisor wishes to prevent from occurring. We derive
   conditions under which a supervisor can detect the presence of an
   intruder in time to prevent the execution of an illegal trace. In
   situations where it is not possible to block all illegal strings, we use
   a language measure method to assess the damage caused by a particular
   set of controllers failing. We also use the language measure technique
   to determine the optimal behavior of the controlled system in the
   presence of an intrusion.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event
   systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing
   the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible.
   Ordinal optimization (OO) is a technique introduced to attack this
   difficulty in system design by looking at ``order{''} in performances
   among designs instead of ``value{''} and providing a probability
   guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The
   selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to
   select as the OO solution, is a key step in applying the OO method.
   Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule
   examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the
   ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first
   identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use
   regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection
   rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good
   selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples.
   Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended. (c)

Abstract = {This paper addresses a security problem in robotic multi-agent systems,
   where agents are supposed to cooperate according to a shared protocol. A
   distributed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is proposed here, that
   detects possible noncooperative agents. Previous work by the authors
   showed how single monitors embedded on-board the agents can detect
   noncooperative behavior, using only locally available information. In
   this paper, we allow such monitors to share the collected information in
   order to overcome their sensing limitation. In this perspective, we show
   how an agreement on the type of behavior of a target-robot may be
   reached by the monitors, through execution of a suitable consensus
   algorithm. After formulating a consensus problem over non-scalar
   quantities, and with a generic update function, we provide conditions
   for the consensus convergence and an upper bound to its transient
   duration. Effectiveness of the proposed solution is finally shown
   through simulation of a case study.},

Abstract = {Initial-state opacity emerges as a key property in numerous security
   applications of discrete event systems including key-stream generators
   for cryptographic protocols. Specifically, a system is initial-state
   opaque if the membership of its true initial state to a set of secret
   states remains uncertain (opaque) to an outside intruder who observes
   system activity through a given projection map. In this paper, we
   consider the problem of constructing a minimally restrictive
   opacity-enforcing supervisor (MOES) which limits the system's behavior
   within some pre-specified legal behavior while enforcing the
   initial-state opacity requirement. To tackle this problem, we extend the
   state-based definition of initial-state opacity to languages and
   characterize the solution to MOES in terms of the supremal element of
   certain controllable, observable and opaque languages. We also derive
   conditions under which this supremal element exists and show how the
   initial-state estimator, which was introduced in our earlier work for
   verifying initial-state opacity, can be used to implement the solution
   to MOES.},

Abstract = {When designers and developers create software they often overlook issues
   related to security. Ideally, protection of the program from illegal
   usage would be considered at each stage of this program's life cycle.
   The proposition put forward here is to augment intrusion detection
   systems (IDSs) and employ them as a tool to support secure software
   development.
   Many state-based intrusion detection methods share structural and
   behavioural similarities with the set of processes known as
   discrete-event systems (DESs). A common structure for modelling DESs is
   the deterministic finite-state automaton. There exist several compatible
   anomaly detection techniques which construct finite-state machine models
   of normal behaviour through the decomposition of associated data (e.g.,
   system calls, HTTP requests) into sequences of events. This paper
   proposes the application of decentralized DES theory to formally analyze
   and enhance these approaches to anomaly detection with misuse
   prevention. Models of misuse attacks are generated in the same manner as
   the legal usage representation, then augmented and integrated into the
   program model to prevent the execution of malicious sequences. The
   technique described herein simultaneously uses anomaly and misuse
   approaches to prevent and disable attacks before their completion.},

Abstract = {Motivated by security and privacy considerations in applications of
   discrete event systems, various notions of opacity have been introduced.
   Specifically, a system is said to be current-state opaque if the
   entrance of the system state to a set of secret states remains opaque
   (uncertain) to an intruder - at least until the system leaves the set of
   secret states. This notion, which has been studied in non-deterministic
   finite automaton settings where the intruder observes a subset of
   events, has been shown to be useful in characterizing security
   requirements in many applications (including encryption using
   pseudo-random generators and trajectory coverage of a mobile agent in
   sensor networks). One limitation of these existing approaches is that
   they fail to provide a quantifiable measure for characterizing the
   degree of opacity of a given system. In this paper, we partially address
   this limitation by extending this framework to systems that can be
   modeled as probabilistic finite automata, characterizing in the process
   the probability of observing a violation of current-state opacity. We
   introduce the notion of step-based almost current-state opacity which
   provides a measure of opacity for a given system. We also propose a
   verification method for this probabilistic notion of opacity and
   characterize its computational complexity.},

Abstract = {Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) based attacks are caused by
   compromised hosts in the LAN and mainly involve spoofing with falsified
   IP-MAC pairs. Since ARP is a stateless protocol such attacks are
   possible. The existing signature or anomaly intrusion detection systems
   are unable to detect these type of attacks. On one hand there are no
   signatures available for these attacks and on the other hand no
   significant statistical behavior change can be observed. Several schemes
   have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks,
   however, these techniques either make IP-MAC pairing static, modify the
   existing ARP, violate network layering architecture, patch operating
   systems etc. In {[}1] Neminath et al. proposed a Discrete Event System
   (DES) based approach for detecting ARP attacks, which solved most of
   these issues. The approach is formal and can be applied to many attack
   cases whose nature is similar to that of ARP, e.g., ICMP informational
   message based attack. However, the work {[}1] did not show its
   completeness i.e., all possible scenarios of ARP spoofing can be
   detected by the scheme. In this paper we show which scenarios of
   spoofing are detected by the scheme and which are missed. Also the
   repercussions of the missed classes are analyzed.},

   reformulate the detection method proposed in {[}1] using renewal theory,
   providing several useful extensions. This reformulation also leads to a
   method that would be applicable to numerous real life signals that exist
   as discrete events, e. g., biological signals. Most importantly renewal
   theory allows us to characterize the performance of our detector and
   determine theoretical bounds on the time-to-detection. Compared to
   alternative methods that use frequency spectra or event arrival rates
   for detection our method is shown to be superior in terms of
   time-to-detection. Further, unlike rate based techniques, our method can
   estimate the multiple periods when multiple periodic anomalies occur
   simultaneously.},

Abstract = {The various fields of application for miniature air vehicles often do
   not provide distinct landing areas or even require additional equipment
   like nets or parachutes to land the aircraft without damaging it. This
   work introduces the deep stall landing (DSL) as a maneuver that uses the
   extraordinary aerodynamic characteristics of a delta wing MAV that come
   into effect after the angle of attack passes the stall angle. This
   landing maneuver is modeled based on a longitudinal aerodynamic model
   that takes lift, drag, thrust, weight, and pitching moment into account.
   By determining the operational modes that the aircraft has to perform in
   order to either complete the landing maneuver or abort it in case of a
   missed approach a hybrid system is identified. This system contains both
   continuous and discrete state dynamics that model the aircraft in each
   landing phase. Based on this hybrid system reachability analyses are
   performed which utilize level set methods to calculate backwards
   reachable sets. These sets are used to identify transitions within the
   modeled system that bring the aircraft form one operational mode to
   another without leaving the safe flight envelope. The final result is a
   discrete event system that covers all possible transitions within the
   refined model. Based on this discrete model an autonomous system can be
   implemented that is able to determine whether the initiation of the
   landing maneuver is safe in terms of keeping the aircraft within the
   safe flight envelope during the whole maneuver. Furthermore the results
   of the reachability analysis determine for which states of the aircraft
   it would be safe to initiate a recovery maneuver in case of a missed
   landing approach.},

Abstract = {A network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a device or software that
   monitors network activities and raises alerts on detection of malicious
   behavior. State-transition based framework like Finite State Machines
   (FSM), extended FSM, timed FSM, Discrete Event Systems (DES) etc. are
   widely used in network IDSs because the framework enables formal
   modeling, analysis, verification etc. The attack detection capability in
   these IDSs is based on passive monitoring of sequence of events with the
   assumption that intrusions lead to change in the sequence (which needs
   to be detected). However, there are certain attacks like ARP spoofing,
   Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error message based attacks
   etc. for which passive monitoring schemes have several limitations
   because in such attacks there is no change in sequence of events. IDSs
   with active probing are now being proposed for such attacks which
   involve sending of probe packets that cause difference in sequence of
   events under attack condition and can be then detected using passive
   monitoring. In this paper we propose an IDS to detect ARP spoofing
   attacks using active state-transition framework called ``active DES{''}.},

Abstract = {Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used for determining the link layer
   or Medium Access Control (MAC) address of a network host, given its
   Internet Layer (IP) or Network Layer address. ARP is a stateless
   protocol and any IP-MAC pairing sent by a host is accepted without
   verification. This weakness in the ARP may be exploited by malicious
   hosts in a Local Area Network (LAN) by spoofing IP-MAC pairs. Several
   schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these
   attacks; however, these techniques either make IP-MAC pairing static,
   modify the existing ARP, patch operating systems of all the hosts etc.
   In this paper we propose a Discrete Event System (DES) approach for
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for LAN specific attacks which do not
   require any extra constraint like static IP-MAC, changing the ARP etc. A
   DES model is built for the LAN under both a normal and compromised
   (i.e., spoofed request/response) situation based on the sequences of ARP
   related packets. Sequences of ARP events in normal and spoofed scenarios
   are similar thereby rendering the same DES models for both the cases. To
   create different ARP events under normal and spoofed conditions the
   proposed technique uses active ARP probing. However, this probing adds
   extra ARP traffic in the LAN. Following that a DES detector is built to
   determine from observed ARP related events, whether the LAN is operating
   under a normal or compromised situation. The scheme also minimizes extra
   ARP traffic by probing the source IP-MAC pair of only those ARP packets
   which are yet to be determined as genuine/spoofed by the detector. Also,
   spoofed IP-MAC pairs determined by the detector are stored in tables to
   detect other LAN attacks triggered by spoofing namely, man-in-the-middle
   (MiTM), denial of service etc. The scheme is successfully validated in a
   test bed. (C) 2010 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Motivated by security and privacy considerations in a variety of
   applications of discrete event systems, we describe and analyze the
   computational complexity required for verifying the notion of K-step
   opacity for systems that are modeled as nondeterministic finite automata
   with partial observation on their transitions. Specifically, a system is
   K-step opaque if, at any specific point within the last observations,
   the entrance of the system state to a given set of secret states remains
   opaque (uncertain) to an intruder who has complete knowledge of the
   system model and observes system activity through some natural
   projection map. We provide two methods for verifying K-step opacity
   using two different state estimator constructions, and analyze the
   computational complexity of both.
   Note to Practitioners-In many emerging security applications, there
   exists a need to guarantee that important information regarding a given
   system remains secret to outsiders, at least for a limited period of
   time. The notion of K-step opacity that we introduce and analyze in this
   paper is appropriate for the security analysis of a system that can be
   modeled as a partially observed and possibly nondeterministic finite
   automaton. The important information that is to be kept secret is
   captured by a subset of the system states. Potential applications
   include the analysis of security requirements when encrypting using
   pseudorandom generators, the analysis of tracking limitations of mobile
   agents in a certain terrain with a given sensor coverage, and the
   analysis of anonymity guarantees in protocols for web transactions.},

Abstract = {Opacity is a confidentiality property that arises in the analysis of
   security properties in networked systems. It characterizes whether
   a{''}secret{''} of a system can be inferred by an outside observer
   called an{''} intruder.{''} We consider the problem of enforcing opacity
   in partially-observed discrete event systems modeled as automata. We
   propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion
   functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output
   of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting
   additional observable events. The insertion function must respond to the
   full system's output behavior. Also, the insertion function should not
   create new observed behavior but only replicate existing observable
   strings. We define the property of `` i-enforceability,{''} when there
   exists an insertion function that renders a non-opaque system opaque. To
   synthesize insertion functions that ensure opacity, we define and
   construct a new structure called the{''} All Insertion Structure{''}
   (AIS). The AIS can be used to verify if a given opacity property is
   i-enforceable. The AIS enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in
   a compact state transition structure. If a given opacity property has
   been verified to be i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to
   synthesize an i-enforcing insertion function.},

Abstract = {We describe and analyze the complexity of verifying the notion of
   infinite-step opacity in systems that are modeled as non-deterministic
   finite automata with partial observation on their transitions.
   Specifically, a system is infinite-step opaque if the entrance of the
   system state, at any particular instant, to a set of secret states
   remains opaque (uncertain), for the length of the system operation, to
   an intruder who observes system activity through some projection map.
   Infinite-step opacity can be used to characterize the security
   requirements in many applications, including encryption using
   pseudo-random generators, coverage properties in sensor networks, and
   anonymity requirements in protocols for web transactions. We show that
   infinite-step opacity can be verified via the construction of a set of
   appropriate initial state estimators and provide illustrative examples.
   We also establish that the verification of infinite-step opacity is a
   PSPACE-hard problem.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we formulate and analyze methodologies for verifying the
   notion of initial-state opacity in discrete event systems that are
   modeled as non-deterministic finite automata with partial observation on
   their transitions. A system is initial-state opaque if the membership of
   its true initial state to a set of secret states remains opaque (i.e.,
   uncertain) to an intruder who observes system activity through some

   security requirements in a variety of applications, including tracking
   problems in sensor networks. In order to model and analyze the intruder
   capabilities regarding initial-state opacity, we first address the
   initial-state estimation problem in a non-deterministic finite automaton
   via the construction of an initial-state estimator. We analyze the
   properties and complexity of the initial-state estimator, and show how
   the complexity of the verification method can be greatly reduced in the
   special case when the set of secret states is invariant. We also
   establish that the verification of initial-state opacity is a
   PSPACE-.complete problem. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In many emerging security applications, a property of a system, that may
   reveal important details about its behaviour, needs to be kept secret
   (opaque) to outside observers (intruders). Motivated by such
   applications, several authors have formalized, analyzed, and described
   methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems of
   interest. This paper offers a review of various definitions of opacity,
   along with methodologies for their verification and complexity analysis.
   We review state-based notions of opacity (namely, current-state opacity
   and initial-state opacity) in non-deterministic finite automata, as well
   as their extensions to stochastic settings. Specifically, we discuss
   these notions of opacity and methods to verify them in discrete event
   systems modeled by non-deterministic finite automata (NFA's) or
   probabilistic finite automata (PFA's).},

Abstract = {Opacity is an important security property dealing with the hiding and
   keeping secret, a subset of a system's behaviour from external
   observers. A system is characterised as ``opaque{''} if it can
   effectively hide specific actions from an intruder or attacker. As the
   need for opacity, and similar fundamental secrecy properties may arise
   in a wide range of applications and sectors, like health care, banking,
   trading and voting systems,... etc., providing efficient tools for its
   verification becomes important, especially for large-scale real-world
   systems.
   In this paper, we formulate opacity, based on labeled transition systems
   models, and provide an efficient verification algorithm within the
   framework of a hybrid on-the-fly approach. Our verification strategy is
   based on the construction of a symbolic observation graph, allowing for
   the abstraction of the system's behaviour, while preserving the
   necessary structure needed for the checking of the opacity property
   dealt with in this paper. The preliminary implementation of our
   algorithm and the provided experimental results are promising, and
   demonstrate its effectiveness in face of the exponential state explosion
   problem, compared with existing techniques.},

Abstract = {A system is said to be current-state opaque if the entrance of the
   system state to a set of secret states remains opaque (uncertain) to an
   intruder-at least until the system leaves the set of secret states. This
   notion of opacity has been studied in nondeterministic finite automata
   settings (where the intruder observes a subset of events, for example,
   via some natural projection mapping) and has been shown to be useful in
   characterizing security requirements in many applications (including
   encryption using pseudorandom generators and coverage properties in
   sensor networks). One limitation of the majority of existing analysis is
   that it fails to provide a quantifiable measure of opacity for a given
   system; instead, it simply provides a binary characterization of the
   system (being opaque or not opaque). In this paper, we address this
   limitation by extending current-state opacity formulations to systems
   that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata under partial
   observation. We introduce three notions of opacity, namely: 1)
   step-based almost current-state opacity; 2) almost current-state
   opacity; and 3) probabilistic current-state opacity, all of which can be
   used to provide a measure of a given system's opacity. We also propose
   verification methods for these probabilistic notions of opacity and
   characterize their corresponding computational complexities.},

Abstract = {Opacity is a confidentiality property that characterizes whether a
   ``secret{''} of a system can be inferred by an outside observer called
   an ``intruder{''}. In this paper, we consider the problem of enforcing
   opacity in systems modeled as partially-observed finite-state automata.
   We propose a novel enforcement mechanism based on the use of insertion
   functions. An insertion function is a monitoring interface at the output
   of the system that changes the system's output behavior by inserting
   additional observable events. We define the property of
   ``i-enforceability{''} that an insertion function needs to satisfy in
   order to enforce opacity. I-enforceability captures an insertion
   function's ability to respond to every system's observed behavior and to
   output only modified behaviors that look like existing non-secret
   behaviors. Given an insertion function, we provide an algorithm that
   verifies whether it is i-enforcing. More generally, given an opacity
   notion, we determine whether it is i-enforceable or not by constructing
   a structure called the ``All Insertion Structure{''} (AIS). The AIS
   enumerates all i-enforcing insertion functions in a compact state
   transition structure. If a given opacity notion has been verified to be
   i-enforceable, we show how to use the AIS to synthesize an i-enforcing
   insertion function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Diagnosis of a system consists in providing explanations to a supervisor
   from a partial observation of the system and a model of possible
   executions. This paper proposes a partial order diagnosis algorithm that
   recovers sets of scenarios which correspond to a given observation.
   Systems are modeled using High-level Message Sequence Charts (HMSCs),
   and the diagnosis is given as a new HMSC, which behaviors are all
   explanations of the partial observation. The main difficulty is that
   some actions of the monitored system are unobservable but may still
   induce some causal ordering among observed events. We first give an
   offline centralized diagnosis algorithm, then we discuss a decentralized
   version of this algorithm. We then give an online diagnosis algorithm,
   and define syntactic criteria under which the memory used can be
   bounded. This allows us to give a complete diagnosis framework for
   infinite state systems, with a strong emphasis on concurrency and causal
   ordering in behaviors. The last contribution of the paper is an
   application of diagnosis techniques to a security problem called anomaly
   detection. Anomaly detection consists in comparing what occurs in the
   system with usual/expected behaviors, and raising an alarm when some
   unusual behavior (meaning a potential attack) occurs.},

Abstract = {The diagnosability condition for a Discrete Event System (DES) model
   requires that there exists no failure indeterminate cycles in the DES
   diagnoser for all failure types. This stringent requirement of DES
   diagnosability condition renders many systems non-diagnosable.
   I-diagnosability framework provides a weaker notion of diagnosability
   than DES diagnosability by considering only those failures that are
   followed by certain observable event(s) known as indicator events.
   However, some systems are I-non-diagnosable even in the presence of an
   indicator event following the failure event. In this paper, we propose
   I2-diagnosability framework overcomes the shortcomings of the
   I-diagnosability framework. In I2-DES framework an empowering event
   ensures that the indicator event sensitizes the failure successfully. We
   have considered a practical example of Advanced Stealth Man in the
   Middle attack in Wi-Fi networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed I-2-DES framework wherein the I-DES framework fails.},

   threats such as viruses, worms etc., are also rapidly increasing. In
   order to detect and prevent such threats, many antivirus softwares have

   easily thwarted by using code obfuscation techniques. In this paper, we
   propose a discrete event systems-based approach to detect obfuscated
   malwares in a system, taking Bagle. A as our test virus. Commonly used
   obfuscation techniques have been applied to bagle. We built DES models
   for a process under attack and normal conditions with system calls as
   events. Based on the system calls evoked by any process, our detector
   will determine its maliciousness by comparing it with both the models.},

Abstract = {We focus on the control and the synthesis of secure timed systems which
   are modelled as timed automata. The security property that the system
   must satisfy is a non-interference property. Intuitively,
   non-interference ensures the absence of any causal dependency from a
   high-level domain to a lower level domain. Various notions of
   non-interference have been defined in the literature, and in this paper,
   we focus on strong non-deterministic non-interference (SNNI) and two
   (bi)simulation-based variants thereof (cosimulation-based SNNI and
   bisimulation-based SNNI). These properties and their extensions have
   been mostly studied in the context of discrete event systems, while it
   is now well-known that time is an important attack vector against secure
   systems.
   At the same time, there is an obvious interest in going beyond simple
   verification to control problems: to be able to automatically make
   systems secure.
   We consider non-interference properties in the challenging setting of
   control of dense-time systems specified by timed automata and we study
   the two following problems: (1) check whether it is possible to find a
   sub-system so that it is non-interferent; if yes, (2) compute a
   (largest) sub-system which is non-interferent.
   We exhibit decidable sub-classes for these problems, assess their
   theoretical complexities and provide effective algorithms based on the
   classical framework of timed games.},

Abstract = {The rapidly changing battle conditions in modern network-centric
   operations prescribe expectations for speedy deployment and nimble ad
   hoc reconfiguration of military networked teams. In this paper, a formal
   command and control (C2) structure is presented that allows for reliable
   ad hoc reconfiguration of tasks and resources of multiple simultaneous
   missions. Missions and assigned resources can be removed or added in an
   online manner without affecting other running missions. A mathematically
   justified software tool called the Reconfigurable Discrete Event Control
   (RDEC) is proposed by extending an existing framework using simple
   matrix decomposition. The RDEC effectively allows multiple fighting
   platforms of different interdisciplinary fields to join and leave the
   network easily in a plug-and-play manner. The proposed C2 structure is
   developed and demonstrated on a simulation study involving a Singapore
   armed forces team with three realistic attack missions. Extensive
   simulation results verify that the networked team is fairly sequenced
   and the missions and resources can be removed or added without blocking
   effects.},

Abstract = {TCP is the most widely accepted transport layer protocol. The major
   emphasis during the development of TCP was its functionality and
   efficiency. However, not much consideration was given on studying the
   possibility of attackers exploiting the protocol, which has lead to
   several attacks on TCP. This paper deals with the induced low rate TCP
   attack. Since the attack is relatively new, only a few schemes have been
   proposed to mitigate it. However, the main issues with these schemes are
   scalability, change in TCP header, lack of formal frameworks, etc. In
   this paper, we have adapted the stochastic DES framework for detecting
   the attack, which addresses most of these issues. We have successfully
   deployed and tested the proposed DES based IDS on a test bed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This paper presents a model of Satellite Base Station (SBS) networks
   subject to malicious attacks and defense actions. The SBS structure and
   the attack-defense actions are modelled as a two-player stochastic game
   and a Nash Equilibrium is computed to obtain the stationary strategy
   guaranteeing the best behaviour. On the basis of this result, the SBS
   dynamics are modelled as a Discrete Event System in a Timed Petri Net
   framework that allows obtaining the evolution of the SBS under the Nash
   Equilibrium and the stochastic game rules.
   A case study describing the cyber security of an SBS is outlined and the
   details of the model are illustrated.},

   the generated event sequence belongs to a secret based on its partial

   language-based opacity in systems modeled by bounded labeled Petri nets.
   We generalize the notion of language opacity to strict language opacity
   to deal with the case where the intruder is only interested in a subset
   of transitions. Furthermore, we show that strict language opacity is
   identical to language opacity for a special class of secrets. A verifier
   is constructed to analyze strict language opacity under the assumption
   that the intruder only cares about observable transitions.},

Abstract = {In computer security, opacity is widely used and considered as a general
   language-theoretic scheme of many security properties of systems. A
   secret behaviour of a system is opaque if a passive attacker can never
   deduce its occurrence from the system observation. In {[}9], instead of
   considering the case of static observability where the set of observable
   events is fixed off-line or dynamic observability where the set of
   observable events changes over time depending on the history of the
   trace, we have introduced Orwellian partial observability where
   unobservable events are not revealed provided that downgrading events
   never occurs in the future of the trace. We show in the previous paper
   verifying opacity for regular secret is opaque for a regular language L
   w.r.t. an Orwellian projection is PSPACE-complete while it has been
   proved undecidable even for a regular language L w.r.t. a general
   Orwellian observation function. In this paper, we address two problems
   of opacification of a regular secret phi for a regular language L w.r.t.
   an Orwellian projection pi(o,d) : Given L and a secret phi is an element
   of L, the first problem consists in computing some minimal regular
   super-language M of L, if it exists, such that phi is opaque for M
   w.r.t. pi(o,d) and the second consists to compute the supremal
   sub-language M' of L such that phi is opaque for M' w.r.t. pi(o,d). We
   derive both language-theoretic characterizations and algorithms to solve
   the two problems.},

Abstract = {Current-state opacity is a key security property in discrete event
   systems. A system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder,
   who only has partial observations on the system's evolution, is never
   able to infer that the current state of the system is within a set of
   secret states. In this work, we address the problem of enforcing
   current-state opacity by supervisory control. Given a system that is
   modeled with a finite automaton and that is not current-state opaque
   with respect to a given secret, the enforcement problem consists in
   designing a supervisor so that the controlled system is current-state
   opaque. We assume that the supervisor can only observe and control a
   subset of events. To be more general, we assume no specific containment
   relationship exists between the sets of events that can be observed by
   the intruder and the supervisor, respectively. We call this general
   setting uncomparable observations. We show that the maximally permissive
   supervisor always exists and propose a novel approach for its design.},

   new separation principle for state estimates which characterizes the
   information dependence in this opacity verification problem. A new
   information structure called the two-way observer is proposed. Based on
   the two-way observer, we provide new algorithms for the verification of

Abstract = {Unlike information, behaviors cannot be encrypted and may instead be
   protected by providing covers that generate indistinguishable
   observations from behaviors needed to be kept secret. Such a scheme may
   still leak information about secrets due to statistical difference
   between the occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers.
   Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) is a possible means of quantifying
   statistical difference between two distributions and was used to measure
   such information leak as in our earlier work {[}1]. This paper studies
   secrecy quantification in stochastic partially-observed discrete event
   systems in the presence of distributed collusive attackers/observers,
   each with its own local partial observability, generalizing the setting
   of single observer in {[}1]. The local observers collude and exchange
   their observations over communication channels that introduce bounded
   delays. We propose a method to compute the JSD-based secrecy measure in
   this distributed setting by introducing bounded-delay channel models to
   extend the system model to capture the effect of exchange of
   observations, and to measure the distributed secrecy loss.},

Abstract = {In many emerging security applications, a system designer frequently
   needs to ensure that a certain property of a given system (that may
   reveal important details about the system's operation) be kept secret
   (opaque) to outside observers (eavesdroppers or intruders). Motivated by
   such applications, several researchers have formalized, analyzed, and
   described methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems
   of interest. This paper introduces and analyzes a notion of opacity in
   systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata or hidden
   Markov models. We consider a setting where a user needs to choose a
   specific hidden Markov model (HMM) out of m possible (different) HMMs,
   but would like to ``hide{''} the true system from intruders, by not
   allowing them to have an arbitrary level certainty as to which system
   has been chosen. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions (that
   can be checked with polynomial complexity), under which the intruder
   cannot distinguish the true HMM, namely, the intruder cannot achieve a
   level of certainty about its decision that is above a certain threshold
   that we can a priori compute.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the cybersecurity issue of ship information
   system (SIS) from a new perspective which is called opacity. For a SIS,
   its confidential information (named as ``secret{''}) may be leaked
   through the working behaviors of each Distributed Control Unit (DCU)
   from an outside observer called an ``intruder{''} which is able to
   determine ship's mission state by detecting the source of each data flow
   from the corresponding DCUs in SIS. Therefore we proposed a dual layer
   mechanism to enforce opacity by activating non-essential DCU during
   secret mission. This mechanism is calculated by two types of insertion
   functions: Safety-assured insertion function (f(IS)) and
   Admissibility-assured insertion function (f(IA)). Due to different
   objectives, f(IS) is designed to confuse intruder by constructing a
   non-secret behaviors from a unsafe one, and the division of fIA is to
   polish the modified output behaviors back to normal. We define the
   property of ``I-2-Enforceability{''} that dual layer insertion functions
   has the ability to enforce opacity. By a given mission map of SIS and
   the marked secret missions, we propose an algorithm to select f(IS) and
   compute its matchable f(IA) and then the DCUs which should be activated
   to release non-essential data flow in each step is calculable. Copyright

Abstract = {One of the major challenges about cyber physical systems is how to
   prevent cyber attacks to ensure system integrity. There has been a large
   number of different types of attacks discussed in the modern control and
   computer science communities. In this paper we aim to investigate one
   special type of attacks in the discrete-event system framework, where an
   attacker can arbitrarily alter sensor readings after intercepting them
   from a target system in order to trick a given supervisor to issue
   control commands improperly, driving the system to an undesirable state.
   We first consider the cyber attack problem from an attacker point of
   view, and formulate an attack with bounded sensor reading alterations
   (ABSRA) problem. We then show that the supremal (or least restrictive)
   ABSRA exists and can be synthesized, as long as the plant model and the
   supervisor model are regular, i.e., representable by finite-state
   automata.},

Abstract = {Opacity is an important information-flow property that arises in
   security and privacy analysis of cyber-physical systems. It captures the
   plausible deniability of the system's ``secret{''} in the presence of a
   malicious intruder modeled as a passive observer. As a specific type of
   opacity, infinite-step opacity requires that the intruder can never
   determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret system for any
   specific instant in the past. Existing works on the analysis of
   infinite-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a
   system is either opaque or non-opaque. However, a
   noninfinite-step-opaque system may only have a small probability of
   violation; this may be still tolerable in many applications. To analyze
   infinite-step opacity more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate
   the verification of infinite-step opacity in the context of stochastic
   discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost
   infinite-step opacity, is proposed to capture whether or not the
   probability of violating infinite-step opacity is smaller than a given
   threshold. This notion is weaker than its purely logical counter-part as
   it takes the transition probability of the system into account. We also
   provide an effective algorithm for the verification of almost
   infinite-step opacity.},

Abstract = {This paper focuses on the Fallback Control System (FCS), which is an
   emergency response method of networked Industrial Control System (ICS)
   as a countermeasure for cyber-attacks. The FCS is disposed on not
   networked controllers but controlled objects. After some incidents
   happen, the FCS isolates the controlled objects from networked
   controllers and controls the objects safely and locally. This ICS
   operation switching is one-way from normal one to fallback one and the
   recovery switching from the fallback one to the normal one still remains
   open. This is because there is a possibility of cyber-attacks aiming the
   reconnection of the controlled objects with the network controllers.
   Motivated by this, this paper proposes a Fallback and Recovery Control
   System (FRCS) by adding a safety recovery switching to the FCS.
   Maintaining the fallback control of the controlled object, the virtual
   operation mode of FRCS connects the networked controller with the
   virtual controlled object (Plant Simulator). The FRCS evaluates the ICS
   soundness from the responses between the controller and the virtual
   object and then reconnects the controller with the actual one. The ICS
   soundness evaluation is based on the discrete-event system observer.
   This paper verifies the validity of the proposed recovery switching via
   a practical experiment. (c) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the context of
   the supervisory control layer. Specifically, we propose a general model
   of a CPS attacker in the framework of Discrete Event Systems (DES) and
   investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given
   controlled system. Our model captures a class of deception attacks,
   where the attacker has the ability to modify a subset of sensor readings
   and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an
   undesirable state. We introduce a new type of a bipartite transition
   structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA), to capture
   the game-like interaction between the supervisor and the environment
   (which includes the system and attacker). This structure is a discrete
   transition system that embeds information about all possible attacker's
   stealthy actions, and all states (some possibly unsafe) that become
   reachable as a result of those actions. We present a procedure for the
   construction of the IDA and discuss its properties. Based on the IDA, we
   discuss the characterization of successful stealthy attacks, i.e.,
   attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the
   system.},

Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication
   capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do
   so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors,
   actuators, and controllers to monitor and control physical systems. The
   use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of the CPS to
   cyber attacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the
   most powerful cyber attacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack,
   where the intruder can observe, hide, create or replace information in
   the attacked network channel. We propose in this paper a defense
   strategy that detects intrusions and prevent damages caused by
   man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control communication
   channels in supervisory control systems. We also introduce the
   definition of NA-Safe controllability, and we propose an algorithm to
   verify this property. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of

Title = {Quantification of Secrecy in Partially Observed Stochastic Discrete

Abstract = {While cryptography is used to protect the content of information (e.g.,
   a message) by making it undecipherable, behaviors (as opposed to
   information) may not be encrypted and may only be protected by partially
   or fully hiding through creation of ambiguity (by providing covers that
   generate indistinguishable observations from secrets). Having a cover
   together with partial observability does cause ambiguity about the
   system behaviors desired to be kept secret, yet some information about
   secrets may still be leaked due to statistical difference between the
   occurrence probabilities of the secrets and their covers. In this paper,
   we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)-based measure to quantify
   secrecy loss in systems modeled as partially observed stochastic
   discrete event systems, which quantifies the statistical difference
   between two distributions, one over the observations generated by secret
   and the other over those generated by cover. We further show that the
   proposed JSD measure for secrecy loss is equivalent to the mutual
   information between the distributions over possible observations and
   that over possible system status (secret versus cover). Since an
   adversary is likely to discriminate more if he/she observes for a longer
   period, our goal is to evaluate the worst case loss of secrecy as
   obtained in the limit over longer and longer observations. Computation
   for the proposed measure is also presented. Illustrative examples,
   including the one with side-channel attack, are provided to demonstrate
   the proposed computation approach.
   Note to Practitioners-Secrecy is the ability to hide private
   information. For communicated information, this can be done through
   encryption or access control. However, the same is not possible for
   system behaviors, and in contrast, cover is introduced for providing
   ambiguity. Quantifying the ability to hide secrets is a challenge. This
   paper provides a means to quantify this in terms of a type of distance
   measure between a secret and its cover. A computation of the same is
   also provided for partially observed stochastic discrete event systems
   and illustrated through a cache's side-channel secrecy loss example.},

Abstract = {In an effort to take effective measures against pirate attacks revealed
   the need to develop models which will contribute to increased protection
   from pirate attacks on ships in areas where there is a high risk of such
   a threat. Therefore, the use of hybrid time Petri nets made simulation
   time dynamics of pirate attack on a ship at sea. In the simulation of
   the time dynamics of events during pirate attacks (Case Study) by using
   Petri nets have been developed, presented and analyzed the most
   unfavorable cases of pirate attack on a ship at sea with additional
   protection of a warship with a helicopter. Three scenarios of pirate
   attacks on a ship with one, two and three pirate ships have been
   prepared and analyzed. Such a system in its own nature is very complex.
   It consists of a continuous portion (Continuous Systems), ie. movement
   of the attacked ship, pirate ship motion and movement naval vessel /
   helicopter (change speed, distance), and the Discrete Event Systems, ie.
   commencing of attack, sending distress. Analyzed the factors that affect
   the safety of navigation of the ship through the area of increased risk
   from possible pirate attacks. The mentioned are typical indicators and
   studied ways of improving the safety in order to finally demonstrate how
   developed applications time dynamics of pirate attacks leads to the
   optimal solution of planning navigation ships through the pirate areas.},

Abstract = {Session initiation protocol (SIP) is an application layer protocol used
   for signaling purposes to manage voice over IP connections. SIP being a
   text-based protocol is vulnerable to a range of denial of service (DoS)
   attacks. These DoS attacks can render the SIP servers/SIP proxy servers
   unusable by depleting memory and CPU time. In this paper, we consider
   two types of DoS attacks, namely, flooding attacks and coordinated
   attacks for detection. Flooding attacks affect both stateless and
   stateful SIP servers while coordinated attacks affect stateful SIP
   servers. We model the SIP operation as discrete event system (DES) and
   design a new state transition machine, which we name as probabilistic
   counting deterministic timed automata (PCDTA) to describe the behavior
   of SIP operations. We also identify different types of anomalies that
   can occur in a DES model, which appear in the form of illegal
   transitions, violating timing constraints, and appear in number which is
   otherwise not seen. Subsequently, we map various DoS attacks in SIP to a
   type of anomaly in DES. PCDTA can learn probabilities of various
   transitions and timings delay from a set of nonmalicious training
   sequences. A trained PCDTA can detect anomalies, and hence various DoS
   attacks in SIP. We perform a thorough experiment with computer simulated
   SIP traffic and report the detection performance of PCDTA on various
   attacks generated through custom scripts.},

Abstract = {A system is said to be opaque if an intruder that observes its evolution

Title = {A new approach for the verification of infinite-step and K-step opacity
   using two-way observers},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {162-171},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the context of security analysis for information flow properties,
   where a potentially malicious observer (intruder) tracks the observed
   behavior of a given system, infinite-step opacity (respectively, K-step
   opacity) holds if the intruder can never determine for sure that the
   system was in a secret state for any instant within infinite steps
   (respectively, K steps) prior to that particular instant. We present new
   algorithms for the verification of the properties of infinite-step
   opacity and K-step opacity for partially-observed discrete event systems
   modeled as finite-state automata. Our new algorithms are based on a
   novel separation principle for state estimates that characterizes the
   information dependence in opacity verification problems, and they have
   lower computational complexity than previously-proposed ones in the
   literature. Specifically, we propose a new information structure, called
   the two-Way observer, that is used for the verification of infinite-step
   and K-step opacity. Based on the two-way observer, a new upper bound for
   the delay in K-step opacity is derived, which also improves
   previously-known results. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   This work addresses the verification of state-based opacity in systems

   set of states. More precisely, two state-based opacity properties are
   considered: current-state opacity and initial-state opacity. We show
   that both current-state and initial-state opacity problems in bounded
   Petri nets can be efficiently solved by using a compact representation
   of the reachability graph, called basis reachability graph (BRG). This
   approach is practically efficient since the exhaustive enumeration of

Title = {An event based technique for detecting spoofed IP packets},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Pages = {32-43},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the prominent
   network security attacks. In DDoS attack several machines send large
   amount of network traffic to the victim using spoofed IP address.
   Unfortunately there is no reliable technique to detect spoofed IP
   packets. In this paper we argue that, a proactive detection of spoofed
   IP packets will help in predicting DDoS attacks. In this paper we
   describe an event based detection method to identify spoofed IP packets.
   Our method works by proactively probing received packets for
   genuineness. Active probing technique uses inconsistencies in TTL values
   of received packets to decide whether the first packet was spoofed or
   genuine. We enumerate several possible spoofing scenarios with our
   detection method in place and identify its type based on the response to
   probing. Further, we study limitations of event based method and discuss
   ways to overcome those. We design and experiment with all spoofing
   scenarios in a real network setup and report the results. With few
   optimizations done to the probing strategy, the overhead incurred can be
   minimized considerably, which makes the proposed technique useful for
   detecting DDoS attacks. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Wi-Fi devices have limited battery life because of which conserving
   battery life is imperative. The 802.11 Wi-Fi standard provides power
   management feature that allows stations (STAs) to enter into sleep state
   to preserve energy without any frame losses. After the STA wakes up, it
   sends a null data or PS-Poll frame to retrieve frame(s) buffered by the
   access point (AP), if any during its sleep period. An attacker can
   launch a power save denial of service (PS-DoS) attack on the sleeping
   STA(s) by transmitting a spoofed null data or PS-Poll frame(s) to
   retrieve the buffered frame(s) of the sleeping STA(s) from the AP
   causing frame losses for the targeted STA(s). Current approaches to
   prevent or detect the PS-DoS attack require encryption, change in
   protocol or installation of proprietary hardware. These solutions suffer
   from expensive setup, maintenance, scalability and deployment issues.
   The PS-DoS attack does not differ in semantics or statistics under
   normal and attack circumstances. So signature and anomaly based
   intrusion detection system (IDS) are unfit to detect the PS-DoS attack.
   In this paper we propose a timed IDS based on real time discrete event
   system (RTDES) for detecting PS-DoS attack. The proposed DES based IDS
   overcomes the drawbacks of existing systems and detects the PS-DoS
   attack with high accuracy and detection rate. The correctness of the
   RTDES based IDS is proved by experimenting all possible attack
   scenarios.},

Abstract = {We investigate security and privacy issues in networked discrete-event
   systems, where supervisory controllers are connected with actuators and
   sensors via communication networks. In this paper, we consider the case
   where the control channel between the supervisor and the actuators may
   not be secure in the sense that the control decisions sent by the
   supervisor can be ``listened{''} by an intruder. We adopt the concept of
   an information-flow property called opacity to capture whether or not
   the networked supervisory control system is secure. Specifically, we say
   that the supervisory control system is opaque with insecure control
   channel if the intruder can never determine for sure that the system is
   in a secret state based on the control decisions sent by the supervisor.
   Based on different control decision transmission mechanisms, two notions
   of opacity are defined. Effective algorithms are also provided to verify
   different notions of opacity for networked supervisory control systems.},

Abstract = {The problem of stealthy attacks for partially-observed discrete event
   systems is considered. An operator observes the plant through an
   observation mask that does not allow him to detect the occurrence of
   certain events (silent events). The observation is corrupted by an
   intruder who can insert and erase some sensor readings. We construct an
   attack structure A which guarantees that, when the plant reaches an
   unsafe state, A can make the operator think that the plant is in a safe
   state. Based on A, we can obtain a stealthy attack structure A(s) by
   simply removing from A all the exposing states, all the weakly exposing
   states and their input and output arcs. The stealthy attack structure
   A(s) only contains the possible attacks that can not be detected by the
   operator.},

Abstract = {Current-state opacity is a key security property in discrete event
   systems. A system is said to be current-state opaque if the intruder,
   who only has partial observation on the system's evolution, is never
   able to establish if the current state of the system is within a set of
   secret states. This paper addresses the problem of enforcing
   decentralized current state opacity using supervisory control. In
   particular, it is assumed that there are multiple intruders trying to
   determine if the current state is in the secret. Given a system that is
   not decentralized current-state opaque, based on the notion of augmented
   I-observer, we propose a modular supervisory synthesis method to design
   a set of supervisors to enforce opacity.},

Abstract = {Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are increasingly deployed in critical
   infrastructures. Originally designed to increase the productivity of ICS
   as well as safety and reliability, nowadays these systems are becoming
   the target of hackers. Several attacks highlighted vulnerabilities, the
   most relevant one, Stuxnet, stroke in 2010. Protection of ICS against
   cyberattacks has to be considered. Security of these systems is
   different from IT security solutions because exchanged data have
   physical consequences. For that, a new approach for Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS) in ICS was presented based on filters monitoring orders and
   reports. Methodology to obtain these filters and their locations in the
   ICS architecture were introduced. In this paper, we present major
   improvements in detection mechanisms of these filters. Distance concept,
   introduced in previous paper (Sicard et al., 2017), is developed and
   combined to trajectory concept that allows filters to detect deviations
   from expected behavior. Distance from optimal or forbidden states is
   essential to compute order sequence bringing back the system into safe
   states. Trajectory, which is the evolution of distance during state
   evolution, improves detection mechanism by analyzing sequences sent to
   the system and received by Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This
   combinational security prevents damages against goods and people.
   Implementation of time based intrusion detection is a step forward for
   improving filters. Temporal windows indicate when actions have to be
   done and if received reports correspond to executed orders. Thus, our
   filter approach secures ICS against combinational and temporal attacks
   affecting security of goods and people or quality. (C) 2018, IFAC

Abstract = {Opacity is a property that ensures that a secret behavior of the system
   is kept hidden from an Intruder. In this paper, we deal with
   current-state opacity, and propose an Opacity-Enforcer that is able to
   change, in an appropriate way, the order of observation in the event
   occurrences in the system, so as to mislead the Intruder to wrongly
   estimate estimate at least one non-secret state. A necessary and

   synthesis is presented and also two algorithms to build the automaton

Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication
   capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do
   so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors,
   actuators, and controllers, implemented, in general, on Programmable
   Logic Controllers (PLC). The use of communication networks increases the
   vulnerability of the CPS to attacks that can drive the system to unsafe
   states. We propose in this paper a defense strategy that prevents
   damages caused by cyber attacks in the sensor and/or actuator
   communication channels of supervisory control systems, without changing
   the behavior of the closed -loop system when it is not attacked. We
   introduce the definitions of DNA and UNA-Security, and present necessary
   and sufficient conditions to verify these properties. (C) 2018, IFAC

Abstract = {With the rapid growth of cyber-physical systems (CPS), the requirements
   on the security of such systems increases, since the communication
   networks between the controllers, actuators and sensors are vulnerable
   to attacks. In this paper, a detection method for cyber attacks on CPSs
   modeled by discrete event systems is proposed. Deception attacks hide
   their influence and are particular challenging to detect. Two such
   attacks are replay attack and covert attack. The modeling and detection
   of these two attack types is presented. We introduce permutation
   matrices which alter the transmitted signals to disrupt the attack and
   allow the detection. The proposed approach is illustrated by a
   laboratory manufacturing system. (C) 2018, IFAC (International

Abstract = {Opacity is a property of discrete event systems (DES) that is related to
   the possibility of hiding a secret to external observers (the
   intruders). The secret can be either a system state, or a sequence of
   events executed by the system itself. When the latter type of secrets is
   considered, the opacity property is referred to as language-based
   opacity (LBO). This paper deals with LBO when the DES is modeled by a
   labeled Petri net. One necessary and sufficient condition to check LBO
   by solving Integer Linear Programming problems is given; such a
   condition exploits the algebraic representation of Petri nets. A
   sufficient condition is then derived, which is less demanding from the
   computational point of view. The effectiveness of the proposed approach
   is shown by means of examples. (C) 2018, IFAC (International Federation

Abstract = {We investigate the problem of synthesizing dynamic masks that preserve
   infinite-step opacity in the context of discrete-event systems. A system
   equipped with a dynamic mask, which acquires information dynamically by
   turning sensors on/off, is said to be infinite-step opaque if an outside
   intruder that can access all information acquired can never infer that
   the system was at some secret state for some specific previous instant.
   Existing works on the dynamic mask synthesis problem only consider
   current-state opacity. However, synthesizing dynamic masks for
   infinite-step opacity, a notion stronger than current-state opacity, is
   much more challenging. The main reason is that delayed information is
   involved in this problem and whether or not a current secret will be
   revealed depends on sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future.
   In this paper, a new type of information state is proposed to capture
   all delayed information in the infinite-step opacity problem. An
   effective algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem.
   Our result extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from
   current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity. (C) 2018, IFAC

Abstract = {Opacity notion is a security and privacy property that verifies whether
   an external observer (intruder) can deduce a secret of a system by
   observing its behaviour. This paper addresses the current state opacity
   verification and enforcement in the framework of Petri Net (PN): an
   observation of the system is said to be current-state opaque if an
   intruder is unable to determine whether the current-state of the system
   belongs to a set of secret states, otherwise it is said to be not
   current-state opaque. The run time verifier waits for an observable
   event and performs an algorithm based on the solution of Integer Linear
   Programming problem to verify the current state opacity and preserve the
   secret. Indeed, if the secret may be discovered, then the last event is
   hidden. An example shows the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C)

   the discrete-event system formalism in the presence of multiple
   intruders. We study two cases, one without coordination among the
   intruders and the other with coordination. We propose appropriate
   notions of opacity corresponding to the two cases, respectively, and
   propose enforcement mechanisms based on the implementation of insertion
   functions, which manipulates the output of the system by inserting
   fictitious observable events whenever necessary. The effectiveness of
   the proposed opacity-enforcement approaches is validated through

Abstract = {In many emerging security applications, a system designer frequently
   needs to ensure that a certain property of a given system (that may
   reveal important details about the system's operation) be kept secret
   (opaque) to outside observers (eavesdroppers). Motivated by such
   applications, several researchers have formalized, analyzed, and
   described methods to verify notions of opacity in discrete event systems
   of interest. This paper introduces and analyzes a notion of opacity in
   systems that can be modeled as probabilistic finite automata or hidden
   Markov models. We consider a setting where a user needs to choose a
   specific hidden Markov model (HMM) out of m possible (different) HMMs,
   but would like to ``hide{''} the true system from eavesdroppers, by not
   allowing them to have an arbitrary level of confidence as to which
   system has been chosen. We describe necessary and sufficient conditions
   (that can be checked with polynomial complexity), under which the
   intruder cannot distinguish the true HMM, namely, the intruder cannot
   achieve a level of certainty about its decision, which is above a
   certain threshold that we can a priori compute.},

Abstract = {We study the enforcement of opacity, an information-flow security
   property, using insertion functions that insert fictitious events at the
   output of the system. The intruder is characterized as a passive
   external observer whose malicious goal is to infer system secrets from
   observed traces of system events. We consider the problems of enforcing
   opacity under the assumption that the intruder either knows or does not
   know the structure of the insertion function; we term this requirement
   as public-private enforceability. The case of private enforceability
   alone, where the intruder does not know the form of the insertion
   function, is solved in our prior work. In this paper, we address the
   stronger requirement of public-private enforceability, that requires
   opacity be preserved even if the intruder knows or discovers the
   structure of the insertion function. We formulate the concept of
   public-private enforceability by defining the notion of public safety.
   This leads to the notion of public-private enforcing (PP-enforcing)
   insertion functions. We then identify a necessary and sufficient
   condition for an insertion function to be PP-enforcing. We further show
   that if opacity is privately enforceable by the insertion mechanism,
   then it is also public-private enforceable. Using these results, we
   present a new algorithm to synthesize PP-enforcing insertion functions
   by a greedy-maximal strategy. This algorithm is the first of its kind to
   guarantee opacity when insertion functions are made public or discovered
   by the intruder. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {On-line verification of current-state opacity by Petri nets and integer
   linear programming},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {205-213},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Opacity is a security and privacy property that evaluates whether an
   external observer (intruder) can infer a secret of a system by observing
   its behavior. This paper proposes an on-line approach to address the
   problem of current-state opacity in discrete event systems (DESs)
   modeled in a labeled Petri Net (PN) framework and by observing its
   evolution. An observation of the system is said to be current-state
   opaque if the intruder is unable to determine whether the current state
   of the system is within a set of secret states, otherwise it is said to
   be not current-state opaque. The proposed approach to verify the
   current-state opacity works on-line: the verification algorithm waits
   for the occurrence of an observable event and uses Integer Linear
   Programming problem solutions to verify if the behavior of the system is
   current-state opaque to the intruder under the given observation.
   Moreover, the proposed method is applied in two different settings: (i)
   a centralized approach where the intruder has full knowledge of the
   system model but can partially observe the system behavior; (ii) a
   decentralized approach where a set of intruders can observe different
   event sets and collaborate with a coordinator to disclose the same
   secret. Finally, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the
   efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Supervisor synthesis to thwart cyber attack with bounded sensor reading
   alterations},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {94},
Pages = {35-44},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {One of the major challenges about cyber-physical systems is how to
   protect system integrity from cyber attacks. There has been a large
   number of different types of attacks discussed in the literature. In
   this paper we aim to investigate one special type of attacks in the
   discrete-event system framework, where an attacker can arbitrarily alter
   sensor readings after intercepting them from a target system, aiming to
   trick a given supervisor to issue improper control commands, which can
   drive the system to an undesirable state. We first consider the cyber
   attack problem from an attacker's point of view, and formulate an
   attack-with-bounded-sensor-reading-alterations (ABSRA) problem. We then
   show that the supremal (or least restrictive) ABSRA exists and can be
   computed, as long as the plant model and the supervisor model are
   regular, i.e., representable by finite-state automata. Upon the
   synthesis of the supremal ABSRA, we present a synthesis algorithm, which
   computes a supervisor that is ABSRA-robust in the sense that any ABSRA
   will either be detectable or inflict no damage to the system. (C) 2018

   systems},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {97},
Pages = {121-133},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The deployment of control systems with network-connected components has
   made feedback control systems vulnerable to attacks over the network.
   This paper considers the problem of intrusion detection and mitigation
   in supervisory control systems, where the attacker has the ability to
   enable or disable vulnerable actuator commands and erase or insert
   vulnerable sensor readings. We present a mathematical model for the
   system under certain classes of actuator enablement attacks, sensor
   erasure attacks, or sensor insertion attacks. We then propose a defense
   strategy that aims to detect such attacks online and disables all
   controllable events after an attack is detected. We develop an
   algorithmic procedure for verifying whether the system can prevent
   damage from the attacks considered with the proposed defense strategy,
   where damage is modeled as the reachability of a pre-defined set of
   unsafe system states. The technical condition of interest that is
   necessary and sufficient in this context, termed ``GF-safe
   controllability{''}, is characterized. We show that the verification of
   GF-safe controllability can be performed using diagnoser or verifier
   automata. Finally, we illustrate the methodology with a traffic control
   system example. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this work, we study supervisory control of discrete event systems in
   the presence of network-based attacks on information delivered to and
   from the supervisors. The attacks are modeled by finite state
   transducers (FSTs), having the ability to nondeterministically rewrite a
   word to any word of a regular language. A desired language is called
   controllable if there exists a security-aware supervisor that ensures
   that the restricted language executed by the plant for any possible
   attack behavior is the desired one we refer to such supervisors as
   attack-resilient. First, we solve the problem of computing the maximal
   controllable sub-language (MCSL) of a desired language and propose the
   design algorithm for an attack resilient supervisor, in scenarios where
   no security guarantees exists for communication between the plant and
   the supervisor. Then, we consider the case where the supervisor has
   active but intermittent access to a size-limited secure channel, which
   ensures integrity and availability of the data transmitted over it.
   Specifically, we propose the notion of accessibility as a measure of
   distance between a language and its sub-language, and show that a
   desired language is controllable with intermittently secure
   communication if and only if its difference from its MCSL without secure
   channel is bounded by the accessibility measure. Finally, we illustrate
   our approach on several examples.},

Abstract = {We consider feedback control systems where sensor readings may be
   compromised by a malicious attacker intent on causing damage to the
   system. We study this problem at the supervisory layer of the control
   system, using discrete event systems techniques. We assume that the
   attacker can edit the outputs from the sensors of the system before they
   reach the supervisory controller. In this context, we formulate the
   problem of synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large
   class of edit attacks on the sensor readings. We solve this problem
   using a new methodology that improves upon prior work on this topic. The
   solution methodology is based on the solution of a partially observed
   supervisory control problem with arbitrary control patterns. We also
   provide results on the existence of a supremal robust supervisor.},

Abstract = {This work focuses on control of discrete event systems (DES) in the
   presence of attacks on their inputs and outputs. We propose to model
   such attacks as nondeterministic finite state transducers (FSTs) and
   show how FSTs can be used to capture a very wide class of attacks
   including all previously considered attacks on DES, as well as
   additional attacks and attack features reported in recent security
   incidents. We study the supervisory control problem in cases when
   attacks occur: (i) only on the sensors, (ii) only on the actuators, and
   (iii) both on the actuators and sensors of the plant. For each case, we
   present new sets of controllability theorems and synthesizing algorithms
   for attack-resilient supervisors. On a series of examples, we illustrate
   the use of our approach for modeling and design of such security-aware
   supervisory control.},

Abstract = {Opacity is an important information-flow property, which is used to
   characterize whether or not the secrets of system have been leaked to
   the intruders. Over the past ten years, opacity of discrete event
   systems (DESs) modeled as automata and Petri nets have been well
   investigated under the assumption that the communication channels
   between systems and intruders are perfect. However, in a shared network,
   the communication delays and losses are inevitable usually. In this
   paper, we investigate the problem of opacity of networked discrete event
   systems (NDESs). We propose the notions of current-state opacity,
   initial-state opacity, initial-final-state opacity, and infinite-step
   opacity for NDESs. We also present the verification algorithms for these
   notions. Some examples are provided to illustrate the results obtained.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security issue in networked
   supervisory control systems over multiple channel networks. We consider
   a networked discrete-event system controlled by a supervisor that
   receives information from sensors and sends control decisions to
   actuators via observations channels and control channels, respectively.
   The security problem is studied for the scenario where some of the
   communication channels are insecure in the sense there exists a passive
   intruder (eavesdropper) that can access the information-flow in those
   insecure communication channels. We adopt the concept of opacity, an
   information flow security property, to characterize the security status
   of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that system
   has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder can
   never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the
   information-flow in the insecure channels. A new network observer is
   proposed to estimate the state of the system with two-side incomparable
   channel information. We show that the opacity verification problem for
   the networked setting can be effectively solved using the proposed
   network observer.},

   In the first step, we consider the problem from the viewpoint of the

   second step, we consider defense mechanisms and formulate the problem of
   synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large class of edit
   attacks.
   We present solution methodologies to these two problems that blend

Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPS) consist of physical processes that are
   controlled or monitored by software and communication capabilities.
   Sensors and actuators are elements of CPS that can be vulnerable to
   attacks. Sensor attacks typically consist in corrupting or hiding
   information received from sensors, or creating nonexisting information.
   Actuator attacks typically consist in intercepting and modifying orders
   sent to actuators. Attacks may lead to serious situations that we will
   call failures. We adopt a discrete event system (DES) approach, where
   information received from sensors and actions realized by actuators are
   represented as discrete events. We first develop a model of the attacked
   system using supervisory control of DES. Then, we study the defense
   viewpoint, where we develop methods to detect attacks and avoid
   failures, and determine conditions of attack detectability and failure
   avoidability. Then, we study the attacker's viewpoint, where we develop
   a strategy based on supervisory control of DES to make the attacker
   undetectable.},

Abstract = {One of alternative ways to achieve a competitive advantage by an
   enterprise in the ICT area is to select the most prospective information
   system (IS) as a seed technology. The latter is defined as a first
   technology from a given area implemented in an enterprise, that
   determines or strongly influences the choice of further technologies
   from the same area. Seed ICT selection is particularly relevant for
   enterprises whose core business activity relies on online service
   provision. In this paper we present a user-requirement-based interaction
   scheme of an application that models the evolution of enterprise ISs,
   taking into account the production patterns of software releases, the
   functionalities offered, the users' community growth trends, and other
   factors. The evolution is modeled by hybrid discrete-time/discrete-event
   systems, and multi-models built with them. The technology choice is
   supported by multicriteria ranking algorithms that apply IS
   innovativeness forecasts. Moreover, this evolution model of enterprise
   IS can handle different uncertainties and cyber security issues. We
   present the use cases and scenarios, model management, and the knowledge
   base that stores time series, IS characteristics and forecasts. The use
   of this application is illustrated by a real-life example of three
   popular open-source CMSs. We conclude that an informed choice of the
   first IS and the corresponding enterprise architecture as a seed
   technology is particularly relevant for start-ups and SMEs. An extended
   variant of the above application may also provide decision support to
   developer teams seeking software evolution models to discover and apply
   the best-possible technology development and market strategies.},

Abstract = {Over the last year, the Internet of Things (IoT) drove the development
   of cyber-physical systems, leading the convergence between information
   and operational technologies. This coupling improves performances and
   saves costs but increases the number of vulnerabilities and the attack
   surface to malicious actors. Consequently, it is mandatory to understand
   how IoT devices can be properly integrated into a more secure
   environment. This issue is even more crucial in the field of Critical
   Infrastructures, such as energy, water, transportation, and
   telecommunications. To this aim, this paper analyzes the concept of
   opacity for Discrete Event, Systems (DES) and applies it to a real
   system. The opacity describes the ability of the system to keep some
   states secret even if an attacker knows the happening of some events.
   The proposed approach is validated by applying the concept of opacity on
   the analysis over a simple system. It is demonstrated that opacity can
   be guaranteed and exploited when systems having different levels of
   security are integrated.},

Abstract = {Rogue Twin Access Point (AP) is a rogue WiFi hotspot/AP setup by an
   adversary solely with the purpose of luring Wi-Fi stations (STAs) into
   connecting to them. An adversary clones the Service Set IDentifier
   (SSID) {[}Hotspot Name] as well as the MAC address of the legitimate AP
   while setting up the rogue twin. When a STA checks for the list of
   available APs (under presence of rogue twin), it sees only one AP
   (despite there being two APs with the identical SSID and MAC address).
   In case the signal strength of the rogue twin is more than the
   legitimate AP, the STA connects to the rogue twin.
   In the present study, a Discrete Event System (DES) paradigm based
   Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detecting rogue twin which is
   proposed. It overcomes many drawbacks of existing approaches in tackling
   rogue twin. A normal DES model corresponding to a frame exchange under
   normal network conditions along with a failure (attacker) DES model
   corresponding to a frame exchange under rogue twin network conditions is
   constructed. Using the knowledge of the normal and attacker DES models,
   a DES diagnoser is constructed to ascertain whether the frame exchange
   corresponds to a normal or attack condition. Even if an attacker uses
   multiple techniques to launch the rogue twin the proposed DES based IDS
   is capable of identifying all such possible instances. We validate the
   scheme on a real test bed.},

Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have emerged as a key technology in the
   development of distributed and autonomous large scale systems. However,
   one of their undesirable side effects is the fact that they are
   particularly exposed to cyber attacks carried out by malicious
   intruders. Therefore, efficient strategies for cyber security are in
   high demand. In this paper, we consider the issue of attack detection in
   the framework of partially observable discrete event systems modeled by
   finite automata. We assume that the observation produced by a plant can
   be corrupted by an intruder which, through one or more attack
   dictionaries, can change events into different strings. The problem we
   address is that of detecting if a plant has been attacked and, if such
   is the case, of identifying the nature of the attack, i.e., which attack
   dictionaries have been used. We show that the problem of attack
   detection can be reduced to a classical problem of state estimation or
   fault diagnosis for a new structure which describes the behavior of the
   plant under attack.},

Abstract = {Wi-Fi technology has seen rapid growth in the last two decades. It has
   revolutionized the way we access the Internet. However, they are
   vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, Encryption Cracking, and Rogue
   Access Points etc. In this manuscript, our focus is on Evil Twin Attack,
   the most common type of Rogue Access Point (RAP). An evil twin AP lures
   client(s) into connecting to it, disguising itself as a genuine AP by
   spoofing its MAC address and SSID (Service Set IDentifier). Once a
   client is connected to the evil twin AP, the attacker can spy on its
   communication, re-direct client(s) to malicious websites, compromise
   credentials. Whitelisting AP(s), timing based solutions, patching
   AP/client etc., are some existing methods to detect evil twin AP(s) in a
   network. However, practically methods demand comprehensive set up and
   maintenance, they suffer from scalability and compatibility issues. Some
   even require protocol modifications, thus making it expensive and
   practically infeasible in a large scale network with no proof of
   correctness. To address these issues, we propose a Discrete Event System
   (DES) based approach for Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for evil twin
   attacks in a Wi-Fi network.},

   face the risks of cyber attacks which might result in catastrophic

   preventing damage caused by cyber attacks in the supervisory control of

   possible links and determine new directions for further research to
   improve the existing literature. For this purpose, first, we classify
   the current research works under a framework consisting of three
   dimensions: 1) the communication channel where an attack can happen, 2)
   the attack impact on the transmitted data, and 3) the mechanism to
   prevent damage. This classification will then help us to compare the
   existing techniques and investigate how they can be improved to get
   closer to the ideal scenario where most kinds of attacks can be handled
   so that the closed-loop system remains safe.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose and address the problem of supervisor
   obfuscation against actuator enablement attack, in a common setting
   where the actuator attacker can eavesdrop the control commands issued by
   the supervisor. We propose a method to obfuscate an (insecure)
   supervisor to make it resilient against actuator enablement attack in
   such a way that the behavior of the original closed-loop system is
   preserved. An additional feature of the obfuscated supervisor, if it
   exists, is that it has exactly the minimum number of states among the
   set of all the resilient and behavior-preserving supervisors. Our
   approach involves a simple combination of two basic ideas: 1) a
   formulation of the problem of computing behavior-preserving supervisors
   as the problem of computing separating finite state automata under
   controllability and observability constraints, which can be tackled by
   using SAT solvers, and 2) the use of a recently proposed technique for
   the verification of attackability in our setting, with a normality
   assumption imposed on both the actuator attackers and supervisors.},

Abstract = {Due to the rapid increase in digitalization and networking of systems,
   especially in industrial environments, the number of cyber-physical
   systems is increasing and thus the danger of possible attacks on such
   systems. As demonstrated in several recent examples, a cyber attack on
   an industrial control system (ICS) can have catastrophic consequences
   for humans and machines. This is due to the communication networks
   between programmable logic controllers (PLC), actuators and sensors,
   which are usually vulnerable to attacks, as well as various processes or
   devices that are not sufficiently protected. In this paper, two possible
   attacks on a discrete event system (DES) are introduced, in which a
   running process, controlled by a PLC, is manipulated without being
   detected. Furthermore, a detection method for such attacks is presented.},

Title = {Infinite-step opacity and K-step opacity of stochastic discrete-event
   systems},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {99},
Pages = {266-274},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Opacity is an important information-flow property that arises in
   security and privacy analysis of cyber-physical systems. Among many
   different notions of opacity, K-step opacity requires that the intruder
   can never determine unambiguously that the system was at a secret state
   for any specific instant within K steps prior to that particular
   instant. This notion becomes infinity-step opacity when K goes to
   infinity. Existing works on the analysis of infinite-step opacity and
   K-step opacity only provide a binary characterization, i.e., a system is
   either opaque or non-opaque. To analyze infinite-step and K-step opacity
   more quantitatively, in this paper, we investigate the verification of
   infinite-step and K-step opacity in the context of stochastic
   discrete-event systems. A new notion of opacity, called almost
   infinite-step opacity (respectively, almost K-step opacity), is proposed
   to capture whether or not the probability of violating infinite-step
   opacity (respectively, K-step opacity) is smaller than a given
   threshold. We also provide effective algorithms for the verification of
   almost infinite-step opacity and almost K-step opacity. (C) 2018

Abstract = {There is a lot of growth in Wi-Fi technology, that has given rise to
   Internet access without the need of wires. In IEEE 802.11 protocol, many
   vulnerabilities are present at the MAC layer which give rise to a lot of
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In this manuscript we mainly
   concentrate on de-authentication DoS attack in Wi-Fi Networks. The
   victim station get disconnects from the network due to the
   de-authentication DoS attack. Minimum resources are required to launch
   the de-authentication attack. However, the schemes for detecting the
   de-authentication DoS attack suffer from major drawbacks namely, require
   protocol modification, require firmware upgradation, no proof of
   correctness etc. To acknowledge these issues, a Discrete Event System
   (DES) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for detection of
   de-authentication attack is proposed.},

   observes the execution of the closed-loop system and eavesdrops the

   the actuator attacker is to remain covert until it can establish a
   successful attack and lead the attacked closed-loop system into
   generating certain damaging strings. We then present a characterization
   for the existence of a successful attacker and prove the existence of
   the supremal successful attacker, when both the supervisor and the
   attacker are normal. Finally, we present an algorithm to synthesize the
   supremal successful normal attackers.},

Abstract = {We study the security of control systems in the context of the
   supervisory control layer of stochastic discrete-event systems. Control
   systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant and the
   controller. In this work, we consider that such communication is
   partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the
   ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the
   supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state.
   We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate
   the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic
   automata. Specifically, we quantify each attack strategy based on the
   likelihood of successfully reaching an unsafe state. The solution
   methodology that we develop uses techniques from the area of stochastic
   graph-games, specifically turn-based one-player stochastic reachability
   games.},

Abstract = {The use of networked controllers is rising and with it the requirements
   for safe and secure communication. In this paper, a controller
   encryption scheme for discrete event systems is presented that secures
   the communication and the information inside the controller. By adapting
   a somewhat homomorphic encryption scheme to encrypt the controller
   parameters and variables, it is much more difficult for attackers to
   gather information about the controller and plant. The homomorphic
   encryption scheme allows the evaluation of encrypted data without
   additional decryption and encryption steps. Thus the controller can be
   evaluated completely in the encrypted domain. We show how to change a
   controller based on a signal interpreted Petri net (SIPN) into an
   encrypted SIPN controller and illustrate the approach by a simulation
   example.},

Abstract = {Communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors, actuators,
   and controllers to monitor and control cyber-physical systems (CPS). The
   use of communication networks increases the vulnerability of the CPS to
   cyber attacks that can drive the system to reach unsafe states. One of
   the most powerful cyber attacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle
   attack, where the intruder can observe, hide, create or replace
   information in the attacked network channel. In a previous paper, we
   have introduced the definition of NA-Safe controllability, that is
   related with the capability of detecting intrusions and preventing
   damages caused by man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or control
   communication channels in supervisory control systems. In this paper, we
   extend our previous work as follows: (i) we prove the correctness of the
   NA-Safe controllability verification algorithm; (ii) we show how to
   implement the security module against cyber attacks; (iii) we show that
   NA-Safe controllability is a necessary and sufficient condition for the
   existence of the security module; and (iv) we present a practical
   example to illustrate the results of the paper.},

Title = {STC: Exposing Hidden Compromised Devices in Networked Sustainable Green
   Smart Computing Platforms by Partial Observation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING},

Abstract = {Large-scale smart computing is generally more vulnerable to cyber
   attacks since their system devices are normally distributed as networked
   platforms and each device could be a target and get compromised. Due to
   resource constraints (i.e., Sustainable Computing demand) and
   cost-efficiency issues (i.e., Green Computing demand), we usually
   monitor only a few devices (i.e., partial observation) to ensure all
   operations across different platforms are under a secure environment.
   This leads to a critical problem for detecting compromised devices that
   are out of surveillance. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has
   not been solved so far. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised
   classifier based on source-tracing technique (STC in short) to expose
   hidden compromised devices with partial observation on the networked
   sustainable green smart computing platforms. STC mainly focuses on the
   cyber threats that can spread in the platform and compromise various
   system devices. To expose hidden compromised devices that are
   out-of-surveillance, STC first captures the spreading source by the
   reverse dissemination technique, and then relies on microscopic
   propagation modelling to probabilistically identify the most probable
   compromised devices. We carried out a series of experiments to validate
   the performance of our proposed method. The evaluations are based on
   three real networked platforms: Air Traffic Control system, AS-level
   Internet platform, and US Power Grid. The experiment results
   demonstrated that STC can accurately expose the hidden compromised
   devices in terms of following aspects: 1) Source-tracing (more than 80
   percent runs got exact real source and 95 percent within two hops of
   real source); 2) Modelling (very close to the simulation results); 3)
   Exposing accuracy (almost all > 90 percent); and 4) Comparison to
   baseline (superiority to three supervised and two unsupervised
   classifiers).},

Abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) facilitates reliable operation of
   systems. Various approaches have been proposed for FDD like Analytical
   redundancy (AR), Principal component analysis (PCA), Discrete event
   system (DES) model etc., in the literature. Performance of FDD schemes
   greatly depends on accuracy of the sensors which measure the system
   parameters. Due to various reasons like faults, communication errors
   etc., sensors may occasionally miss or report erroneous values of some
   system parameters to FDD engine, resulting in measurement inconsistency
   of these parameters. Schemes like AR, PCA etc., have mechanisms to
   handle measurement inconsistency, however, they are computationally
   heavy. DES based FDD techniques are widely used because of computational
   simplicity, but they cannot handle measurement inconsistency
   efficiently. Existing DES based schemes do not use Measurement
   inconsistent (MI) parameters for FDD. These parameters are not
   permanently unmeasurable or erroneous, so ignoring them may lead to weak
   diagnosis. To address this issue, we propose a Measurement inconsistent
   discrete event system (MIDES) framework, which uses MI parameters for
   FDD at the instances they are measured by the sensors. Otherwise, when
   they are unmeasurable or erroneously reported, the MIDES invokes an
   estimator diagnoser that predicts the state(s) the system is expected to
   be in, using the subsequent parameters measured by the other sensors.
   The efficacy of the proposed method is illustrated using a pump-valve
   system. In addition, an MIDES based intrusion detection system has been
   developed for detection of rogue dynamic host configuration protocol
   (DHCP) server attack by mapping the attack to a fault in the DES
   framework.},

Abstract = {Since the beginning of the 21th century, Industrial Control Systems
   (ICS) have been targeted by hackers. The main motives for the interest
   to ICS is the ease for performing cyberattacks and the potential damages
   inflicted to the system and its environment in case of success. The
   purpose of this paper is to propose an approach for detecting malicious
   orders in discrete-event system. Four types of attacks (direct
   sequential, temporal and over soliciting) that affect an industrial
   system are studied in this work. Based on the vulnerabilities in ICS and
   the positioning of other techniques, an innovative methodology is
   exposed in this paper to develop detection mechanisms based on the
   ``automation-knowledge{''}. Thus, by using models of system with an
   improved notion of distance and trajectory, our filters based approach
   provides good results for detecting cyberattacks in lower levels of ICS
   architecture by analyzing the malicious nature of the orders sent.
   Different types of detection mechanisms based on the concept of distance
   and trajectory are detailed in this study. We also provide results on
   simulation examples and an industrial platform. To conclude,
   improvements of our approach are discussed.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with a problem related to the observability of discrete
   event systems: the initial-state opacity. Given a set of system states
   (the secret), a system observation is called initial-state opaque if an
   agent (named intruder), who can partially observe the system, cannot
   determine whether the set of initial states consistent with an event
   sequence is included in the secret. Such a character can describe
   security problems in cyber-infrastructures, such as Internet and mobile
   communication networks or national defense service systems. This work
   presents a novel on-line methodology to verify the notion of
   initial-state opacity of discrete event systems that are modeled by
   labeled Petri nets. By working on-line, the intruder records an event
   and exploits integer linear programming problem for checking the
   initial-state opacity of the system's evolution under the given
   observation. A set of examples are shown to shed light on the efficiency
   of the presented methodology. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {This note investigates enforcement of opacity by nondeterministic edit
   functions. The edit functions alter the system's output by inserting
   fictitious events or erasing observed events. The edit decisions are
   randomly made while not known by the outside environment a priori. There
   is an intruder characterized as a passive observer with malicious goals
   to infer the secrets of the system. We require that opacity be enforced
   when the intruder may or may not know the implementation of edit
   functions. This requirement is termed as private and public safety. We
   also restrict the operation of edit functions by defining edit
   constraints. Then, the opacity enforcement problem is transformed to a
   three-player game among the edit function, the environment, and a dummy
   player, which helps to determine edit decisions. A game structure called
   the all edit structure (AES) is introduced to characterize the
   interaction among those players. It embeds all privately safe edit
   functions and may also embed publicly safe edit functions. Based on the
   AES, we present an algorithm that provably synthesizes nondeterministic
   edit functions that satisfy both private safety and public safety.},

Title = {Enforcing opacity by insertion functions under multiple energy
   constraints},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {108},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the enforcement of opacity by insertion
   functions subject to multiple quantitative constraints capturing
   resource or energy limitations. There is a malicious intruder attempting
   to infer secrets of the system from its observations. To prevent the
   disclosure of secrets, the insertion function inserts fictitious events
   to the output of the system to obfuscate the intruder. The system is
   initialized with several types of resources, referred to as energy. The
   energy is consumed or replenished with event occurrences while always
   consumed with event insertions. The insertion function must enforce
   opacity while ensuring that each type of resource is never depleted.
   This problem is then reduced to a two-player game between the insertion
   function and the system (environment), with properly defined objectives.
   A game structure called the Energy Insertion Structure, denoted by EIS
   is proposed, which provably contains solutions to the energy constrained
   opacity enforcement problem. Then we further study the bounded cost rate
   insertion problem on the insertion function's winning region of EIS,
   which requires that the long run average rate of insertion cost be
   bounded. This problem is formulated as a multidimensional mean payoff
   game and a special method called hyperplane separation technique is
   applied to efficiently solve it. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {We consider a multi-adversary version of the supervisory control problem
   for discrete-event systems (DES), in which an adversary corrupts the
   observations available to the supervisor. The supervisor's goal is to
   enforce a specific language in spite of the opponent's actions and
   without knowing which adversary it is playing against. This problem is
   motivated by applications to computer security in which a cyber defense
   system must make decisions based on reports from sensors that may have
   been tampered with by an attacker. We start by showing that the problem
   has a solution if and only if the desired language is controllable (in
   the DES classical sense) and observable in a (novel) sense that takes
   the adversaries into account. For the particular case of attacks that
   insert symbols into or remove symbols from the sequence of sensor
   outputs, we show that testing the existence of a supervisor and building
   the supervisor can be done using tools developed for the classical DES
   supervisory control problem, by considering a family of automata with
   modified output maps, but without expanding the size of the state space
   and without incurring on exponential complexity on the number of attacks
   considered.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates attack mitigation problem in supervisory control
   of discrete event systems. We consider the scenario where the system is
   subject to actuator enablement attack. We explicitly distinguish between
   controllable events and defendable events; the former are events that
   can be disabled by the normal supervisor but may be subject to attack,
   while the latter are events that can be defensed (disabled definitely)
   by the mitigation module but possibly with higher costs. The objective
   is to design an attack mitigation strategy to prevent serious damage
   from attack. We formulate the attack mitigation problem as a tolerant
   control problem under partial observation. Particularly, in addition to
   guarantee safety, we aim to maximize the desirable behavior (normal
   specification) while minimize the tolerable behavior (safe but not
   desirable). We provide an effective online algorithm for solving this
   problem, which yields a novel attack mitigation strategy that
   generalizes the existing one in the literature. Specifically, we show
   that the proposed strategy may still prevent damage even when the
   safe-controllability condition, which is required by the existing
   strategy, does not hold.},

Abstract = {6LoWPAN, an adaptation layer designed by IETF, is meant for IPv6
   connectivity over lossy links and low power resource constrained devices
   using the IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Of late, the growing emergence of
   Internet of Things (IoT) enabled devices in areas such as industrial
   Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and home automation has mobilized extensive
   implementation of 6LoWPAN. However, absence of authentication mechanisms
   render the adaptation layer prone to various attacks arising out of
   duplicated or fabricated fragments. Buffer Reservation Attack targets
   the vulnerability induced due to fictitious allocation of the buffer,
   which then denies new packets from occupancy till timeout. Existing
   research works to mitigate such attacks resort to cryptographic
   solutions and split buffer approaches to intelligently guarantee buffer
   reservation. In this paper we propose an attacker revelation scheme
   using Discrete Event Systems (DES) in the framework of Finite State
   Machines (FSM). The motivation behind our countermeasure is that no work
   has addressed identification of the adversary in 6LoWPAN setting before.
   We detect the attack using Wireshark analytics and identify the
   malicious node from responses to probe packets using a DES based state
   estimator which ensures correctness too. Our approach is tested on
   Contiki OS and experimental results show that the proposed scheme
   provides energy efficient solutions with lesser response times compared
   to the state of the art solutions.},

Abstract = {Opacity is an important information secure property. A system is said to
   be infinite-step opaque if the intruder is never able to ascertain that
   the system is or has been in a secret state at some time, based on its
   observation of the system evolution. This work aims to verify
   infinite-step opacity of discrete event systems modeled with labeled
   Petri nets. Based on the notion of basis reachability graph, a new
   structure called basis two-way observer is proposed to check
   infinite-step opacity of a bounded system, which is shown to be more
   efficient than the standard method based on the reachability graph.

Abstract = {One of the most important challenges for the application of
   cyber-physical systems (CPS) in smart industries is ensuring its
   security against cyber attacks. In this paper, we consider that the CPS
   is abstracted as a Discrete-Event System (DES), and we consider cyber
   attacks where the intruder eavesdrops the sensor communication channel
   to detect the occurrence of a sequence in the secret behavior of the
   system. In order to prevent the attacker from getting information from
   the sensor channel, we introduce a new cryptographic scheme based on
   events called event-based cryptography. We also define the property of
   confidentiality of DES, present a necessary and sufficient condition for
   ensuring this property, and propose a verification test. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Cybersecurity in Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a crucial problem,
   as recent history has shown. A notable characteristic of ICS, compared
   to Information Technology, is the necessity to take into account the
   physical process, and its specific dynamics and effects on the
   environment, when considering cybersecurity issues. Intrusion Detection
   Systems have been studied extensively. In our work, we address the less
   classic topic of response mechanisms, and their automation in a
   self-protection feedback loop. More precisely, we address
   self-protection seen as resilience, where the functionality of the
   system is maintained under attacks, be it in a degraded mode. We model
   this as a Discrete Event Systems supervisory control problem, involving
   a model of the plant's possible behaviors, a model of considered
   attacks, and a formulation of the control objectives. We consider a case
   study, and perform a prototype implementation and simulation, using the
   Heptagon/BZR programming language and compiler/code generator, and
   targeting a multi-PLC experimental platform. Copyright (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the enforcement of opacity via supervisory

   opaque if the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can
   never infer confidentially that the system is at a secret state. The
   design objective is to synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop
   system is opaque even though the control policy is publicly known. We
   propose to use non-deterministic supervisors, provides a set of control
   decisions at each instant, to enforce opacity. Such a nondeterministic
   control mechanism can enhance the plausible deniability of the
   controlled system as the online control decision cannot be implicitly
   inferred from the control policy. We provide an effective approach to
   synthesize a non-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. We show
   that non-deterministic supervisors are strictly more powerful than
   deterministic supervisors. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

Abstract = {Opacity is an information flow property characterizing whether a system
   reveals its secret to an intruder. Verification of opacity for
   discrete-event systems modeled by automata is in general a hard problem.
   We discuss the question whether there are structural restrictions on the
   system models for which the opacity verification is tractable. We
   consider two kinds of automata models: (i) acyclic automata, and (ii)
   automata where all cycles are only in the form of self-loops. In some
   sense, these models are the simplest models of (deadlock-free) systems.
   Although the expressivity of such systems is weaker than the
   expressivity of linear temporal logic, we show that the opacity
   verification for these systems is still hard. Copyright (C) 2020 The

Abstract = {In discrete-event systems, the opacity of a secret ensures that some
   behaviors or states cannot be inferred with certainty from partial
   observation of the system. Enforcing opacity in a discrete-event system,
   encoded by a finite labelled transition system (LTS), is a way to avoid
   information leakage. Checking opacity is decidable but costly (EXPTIME
   in the worst cases). This paper addresses opacity for modular systems in
   which every module, represented by an LTS, has to protect its own secret
   (a set of secret states S) w.r.t. a local attacker. Once the system is
   composed, we assume a coalition between the attackers that share their
   local view (called the global attacker). Assuming the global attacker
   can observe all interactions between modules, we provide a
   reduced-complexity opacity verification technique and an algorithm for
   constructing local controllers that enforce-; opacity for each secret
   separately. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

Abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of detection and prevention of cyber
   attacks in discrete event systems where the supervisor communicates with
   the plant via network channels. Random control delays may occur in such
   networked systems, hence the control of the supervisor could be
   affected. Furthermore, there is an attacker targeting the vulnerable
   actuators. The attacker can corrupt the control input generated by the
   supervisor, and aims at driving the plant to unsafe states. We propose a
   new approach to model the closed-loop system subject to control delays
   and attacks. The notion of AE-safe controllability in the networked
   control system is defined: it describes the ability to prevent the plant
   from reaching unsafe states after attacks are detected. A method for
   testing AE-safe controllability is also presented. Copyright (C) 2020

Abstract = {The problem of stealthy sensor attacks for labeled Petri nets is
   considered. An operator observes the plant to establish if a set of
   critical markings has been reached. The attacker can corrupt the sensor
   channels that transmit the sensor readings, making the operator
   incapable to establish when a critical marking is reached. We first
   construct the stealthy attack Petri net that keeps into account the real
   plant evolutions observed by the attacker and the corrupted plant
   evolutions observed by the operator. Starting from the reachability
   graph of the stealthy attack Petri net, an attack structure is defined:
   it describes all possible attacks. The supremal stealthy attack
   substructure can be obtained by appropriately trimming the attack
   structure. An attack function is effective if the supremal stealthy
   attack substructure contains a state whose first element is a critical
   marking and the second element is a noncritical marking. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {Cyber-attack models and their respective mitigation strategies have been
   recently studied in the discrete event systems setting. Previous work
   focuses on whether unsafe behaviour can be prevented using supervisory
   control theory. When unsafe behaviour cannot be prevented with
   certainty, mitigation strategies are limited. This paper proposes the
   use of a probabilistic discrete event system (PDES) framework to
   incorporate a likelihood measure for unsafe behaviour in the attack
   models presented in Carvalho et al. (2018). The least-unsafe (LU)
   supervisor problem is introduced to minimize this unsafe likelihood
   measure and improve existing attack mitigation techniques. The LU
   supervisor problem under full observability is solved by reformulating
   it into an MDP problem, and a computable algorithm is developed. Lastly,
   the implementation of LU supervisors is discussed and illustrated with
   an example. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

   systems framework and present a coordination strategy for two agents to
   search a simple maze that involves no communication, thereby eliminating
   any cyber-security threats. Our strategy involves two agents having
   reverse priority decision-making policies, while searching the maze with
   a depth-first search control policy. Under our definition of
   inefficiency, which is a function of the number of dead end states that
   are searched by both agents, we show that our method achieves the
   minimum inefficiency cost, and thus performs as well as any

Abstract = {The rapidly growing use of modern computer-integrated systems involving
   critical assets underscores the need for developing measures to
   guarantee their security against malicious attacks. This paper deals
   with the problem of language-based opacity formulation and verification
   in the framework of discrete event systems modeled with partially
   observed Petri nets (POPNs). In this context, a secret behavior is
   defined as a sub-language that should be hidden from an intruder who
   partially observes the system's evolution. A Petri net system is
   qualified as language opaque if no observation leads to an event
   sequence estimation that is entirely contained in a secret. In this
   paper, we develop a depth-first search algorithm that verifies the
   language opacity of a POPN system. More specifically, the proposed
   algorithm checks the existence of a non-secret transition sequence that
   is observably equivalent to a secret one by performing a depth-first
   search on a portion of the system's execution. Complexity analysis and
   experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the
   proposed approach. Copyright (C) 2020 The Authors.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of synthesizing
   maximally-permissive opacity-enforcing supervisors for
   partially-observed discrete-event systems. We focus on a specific type
   of opacity called infinite-step opacity requiring that the intruder,
   which is modeled as a passive observer, can never determine for sure
   that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific instant. When
   the original system is verified to be non-opaque, one is interested in
   synthesizing a supervisor that controls the system in a
   least-restrictive manner such that the closed-loop system is opaque. We
   provide an effective approach for solving the infinite-step opacity
   control problem by re-formulating this problem as a two-player game over
   a generalized information structure that involves information delays. We
   show that the proposed synthesis algorithm is sound and complete, and
   the resulting supervisor is maximally-permissive. Most of the existing
   works on opacity-enforcing supervisory control only consider
   current-state opacity in which no delayed information is involved. Our
   work provides a complete solution to the infinite-step opacity control
   problem without any assumption on the relationship between controllable
   events and observable events.},

Title = {Homomorphic Encryption of Supervisory Control Systems Using Automata},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {147185-147198},
Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems have been highly integrated into many
   contemporary infrastructures. As this integration deepens, the
   importance of protecting these systems from unauthorized access and data
   corruption increases. Nowadays, cyber-physical systems are not well
   protected against network attacks. One solution is to improve the
   security of a system by encrypting the transmitted data. In this paper,
   we consider the encryption of supervisors of discrete event systems
   modeled with deterministic finite-state automata. We propose an
   encryption framework of supervisory control systems based on the matrix
   notation of automata. The purpose of using matrix notation is to make it
   suitable for homomorphic encryption schemes over integers, which are
   emerging in the cryptography area. We calculate the entropy of the
   matrix notation and find that as the size of a system increases, it gets
   smaller and approaches zero. Owing to the low entropy of the matrix
   notation, we propose an algorithm to enhance its entropy. By applying
   the entropy-enhancing process, the distribution characteristics of
   entries in matrices or vectors can be hidden to avoid a brute force
   attack. Correspondingly, we propose an entropy restoration algorithm to
   ensure that the control action can be transmitted correctly.},

Abstract = {Opacity, a confidentiality property, is an increasing concern in
   cyber-physical systems (CPSs) that are vulnerable to an intruder which
   intends to reveal a ``secret{''} of a system. This note presents a new
   framework for opacity and considers the problem of enforcing opacity in
   CPSs modeled as linear time-invariant systems. The confidential
   information involves the CPS' interference attenuation capacity (IAC),
   called the secret. A system is opaque if the intruder never infers the
   secret IAC from an observation mapping of system output. To guarantee
   the confidentiality requirement, an effective algorithm is proposed for
   synthesizing opacity-enforcing controllers by using a new
   approximation-based Q-learning. A main advantage of this method is that
   it does not require any knowledge of the system dynamics matrices. A
   simulation example is presented to sustain the theoretical results.},

Abstract = {We investigate the problem of synthesizing dynamic masks that preserve
   the infinite-step opacity in the context of discrete-event systems.
   Dynamic mask is an information acquisition mechanism that controls the
   observability of the system's events dynamically online, e.g., by
   turning sensors on/off. A system equipped with a dynamic mask is said to
   be infinite-step opaque if an outside intruder that can access all
   acquired information can never infer that the system was at some secret
   state for any specific previous instant. Existing works on the dynamic
   mask synthesis problem can only preserve the current-state opacity.
   However, synthesizing dynamic masks for the infinite-step opacity, which
   is stronger than the current-state opacity, is much more challenging.
   The main reason is that the delayed information is involved in this
   problem and whether or not a current secret can be revealed depends on
   sensing decisions to be synthesized in the future. In this paper, a new
   type of information state is proposed to capture all the delayed
   information in the infinite-step opacity synthesis problem. An effective
   algorithm is then presented to solve the synthesis problem, which
   extends existing dynamic mask synthesis techniques from the
   current-state opacity to infinite-step opacity. Additionally, an
   information-state-reduction-based approach is proposed to further
   mitigate the computational complexity of the synthesis procedure.
   Finally, we discuss how to generalize our results to a class properties
   with delayed information including infinite-step K-anonymity and
   infinite-step indistinguishability.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we shall formulate and address a problem of covert
   actuator attacker synthesis for cyber-physical systems that are modeled
   by discrete-event systems. We assume the actuator attacker partially
   observes the execution of the closed-loop system and is able to modify
   each control command issued by the supervisor on a specified attackable
   subset of controllable events. We provide straightforward but in general
   exponential-time reductions, due to the use of subset construction
   procedure, from the covert actuator attacker synthesis problems to the
   Ramadge-Wonham supervisor synthesis problems. It then follows that it is
   possible to use the many techniques and tools already developed for
   solving the supervisor synthesis problem to solve the covert actuator
   attacker synthesis problem for free. In particular, we show that, if the
   attacker cannot attack unobservable events to the supervisor, then the
   reductions can be carried out in polynomial time. We also provide a
   brief discussion on some other conditions under which the exponential
   blowup in state size can be avoided. Finally, we show how the reduction
   based synthesis procedure can be extended for the synthesis of
   successful covert actuator attackers that also eavesdrop the control
   commands issued by the supervisor.},

Title = {Current-state opacity modelling and verification in partially observed
   Petri nets},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {System opacity is a widely studied security notion, implying that a
   secret behaviour of a given system cannot be seen or assessed by an
   external observer based on the system evolution. This work deals with
   the problem of current-state opacity formulation and verification in the
   context of discrete event systems modelled with partially observed Petri
   nets (POPNs) (i.e., Petri nets containing place sensors that measure the
   number of tokens in observable places and event sensors that indicate
   the firing of observable transitions). A Petri net system is recognized
   as current-state opaque if the current-state estimate is never entirely
   contained in the set of secret states. In this regard, we introduce the
   notion of discernible markings to design a reduced state estimator
   called a discernible reachability graph, and then come up with formal
   modelling of current-state opacity in POPN systems. The main idea of the
   proposed approach consists in proving that if a system is current-state
   opaque, its current-state estimate, possibly established by an intruder,
   contains at least one non-secret state. We exploit the mathematical
   feasibility to formulate this concept by defining and solving an integer
   linear programming problem with respect to a given secret and an
   observation sequence collected from sensors. In the light of the
   proposed modelling, necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed for
   opacity verification, and examples are given to expose the results. (C)

Abstract = {Opacity is a confidential property characterizing whether the secret of
   a system can be inferred or not by an outside observer (also called an
   intruder). This paper focuses on presenting a matrix-based approach for
   verification of opacity of nondeterministic discrete event systems
   (DESs). Firstly, the given system is modeled as a finite-state
   automaton. Further, based on Boolean semi-tensor product (BSTP) of
   matrices, the algebraic expression of the observable dynamic of the
   system can be obtained. We, respectively, investigate current-state
   opacity andK-step opacity owing to the equivalence between a few opacity
   properties. Finally, necessary and sufficient conditions are presented
   to verify whether the secret is opaque for a given system, and the
   proposed methodology is tested effectively by examples. The matrix-based
   characterization of opacity proposed in this paper may provide a helpful
   angel for understanding the structure of this property.},

Abstract = {This article develops a novel compositional and abstraction-based
   approach to synthesize edit functions for opacity enforcement in modular
   discrete event systems. Edit functions alter the output of the system by
   erasing or inserting events in order to obfuscate the outside intruder,
   whose goal is to infer the secrets of the system from its observation.
   We synthesize edit functions to solve the opacity enforcement problem in
   a modular setting, which significantly reduces the computational
   complexity compared with the monolithic approach. Two abstraction
   methods called opaque observation equivalence and opaque bisimulation
   are first employed to abstract the individual components of the modular
   system and their observers. Subsequently, we propose a method to
   transform the synthesis of edit functions to the calculation of modular
   supremal nonblocking supervisors. We show that the edit functions
   synthesized in this manner correctly solve the opacity enforcement
   problem.},

Abstract = {Initial-state estimation consists in determining the initial state of
   the system based on the observation from the system and the system
   structure. It is the basis for many problems in security applications,
   such as opacity, detectability and supervisory control. However, when it
   comes to cyber-physical systems (CPS) communication delays and losses
   are inevitable. In this letter, we study the initial-state estimation
   problem in a CPS that is modeled with a multi-channel networked discrete
   event system (NDES). In practice, the system is usually distributed over
   several locations, and the communication between the system and an agent
   (e.g., intruder, observer, supervisor) is carried out via a shared
   network, in which communication delays and losses may happen. In
   multi-channel NDESs, even when the first-in first-out rule is satisfied
   in each channel, the order of events received by the agent may still be
   shuffled due to random communication delays in each channel. To address
   these new challenges, we formalize the initial-state estimation problem
   in multi-channel NDESs and a networked initial-state estimator is
   proposed to generate the exact initial-state estimate.},

Title = {K-memory-embedded insertion mechanism for opacity enforcement},
Journal = {SYSTEMS \& CONTROL LETTERS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {145},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Opacity is a privacy property which aims to determine whether the
   ``secret{''} of a system can be deduced by an outside intruder. In this
   paper, we investigate the enforcement of opacity using insertion
   functions which insert additional events if necessary to modify the
   output of the system. Inspired by the existing insertion mechanisms, we
   propose a mechanism named k-memory-embedded insertion mechanism for the
   enforcement of opacity. In our k-memory-embedded insertion mechanism,
   the insertion functions are determined based on the knowledge of
   system's exact states and the stored next sequence of events with length
   k. Especially, we define the property of i(k)-E-enforceability that a
   k-memory-embedded insertion function needs to satisfy for opacity
   enforcement, and further construct a verifier to determine whether a
   given opacity notion of the system is i(k)-E-enforceable or not. Our
   mechanism improves the embedded insertion mechanism by applying to a
   broader class of systems. Also, we improve the k-memory insertion
   mechanism by requiring a smaller number of consecutive events which need
   to be stored. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We study the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) in the context of
   the supervisory control layer. Specifically, we propose a general model
   of a CPS attacker in the framework of discrete event systems and
   investigate the problem of synthesizing an attack strategy for a given
   feedback control system. Our model captures a class of deception
   attacks, where the attacker has the ability to hijack a subset of sensor
   readings and mislead the supervisor, with the goal of inducing the
   system into an undesirable state. We utilize a game-like discrete
   transition structure, called Insertion-Deletion Attack structure (IDA),
   to capture the interaction between the supervisor and the environment
   (which includes the system and the attacker). We show how to use IDAs to
   synthesize three different types of successful stealthy attacks, i.e.,
   attacks that avoid detection from the supervisor and cause damage to the
   system. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a general framework is proposed for the analysis and
   characterization of critical observability of finite state systems,
   affected by malicious attacks. Critical observability is defined with
   respect to a critical set, and corresponds to the property of
   immediately detecting the belonging of the current state to such
   critical set, based on the knowledge of the output evolution of the
   system. This concept, analyzed before for the nominal case, in which the
   model is known, as well as the function which associates to each state
   an output symbol, is here extended to the case in which there is an
   intrusion in the system, which could cause replacement or removal of
   output symbols, or injection of symbols in the output string. Therefore
   the problem consists in giving conditions under which critical
   observability is preserved, despite possible attacks. Different attacker
   models are considered. The case of attacks where the presence of the
   attacker cannot be detected is also addressed. The problem is solved in
   a set membership framework, which guarantees polynomial complexity of
   the proposed algorithms.},

Abstract = {Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), an IETF-standardized web
   transfer protocol, is specially designed to facilitate
   resource-constrained devices and low power, lossy networks. The steep
   rise in extensive deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, of
   late, makes it necessary for web services to be used over the internet
   by constrained wireless nodes for a majority of Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
   applications. However, considering that the system is constrained,
   ensuring security is a challenge when employing CoAP since it uses User
   Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is unrealiable and lacks handshaking
   mechanism. A malicious endpoint with read and write access can severly
   jeopardize service availability by launching an IP address spoofed
   attack. Moreover, it can help mount other complex Distributed
   Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks like amplification attacks. Though
   response spoofing vulnerability has been addressed in the research
   community for quite some time now, request spoofing countermeasures are
   relatively few. In this paper, we propose an attacker identification
   scheme using a Discrete Event System (DES) based Intrusion Detection
   System (IDS). Through our scheme, we not only detect request and
   response spooling attack in CoAP, but also identify the adversarial node
   by analysing the LoWPAN event dynamics generated due to probe responses.
   Correctness of our approach is guaranteed by construction of a DES
   diagnoser. We have tested our approach on Contiki OS. The experimental
   results show our proposed scheme to be energy efficient with response
   time of approx 6 sec at 99.2\% accuracy.},

Abstract = {Recently, the problem of model-based synthesis of covert attackers has
   received a lot of attention in the discrete event systems literature.
   However, all the existing works assume the model of the supervisor to be
   available (to the adversary) for the synthesis to be effective, which
   can be unrealistic in practice. In this work, we consider a much more
   challenging, but more practical, setup where the model of the supervisor
   is in general not available. To compensate this lack of knowledge, we
   assume that the adversary has recorded a (prefix-closed) finite set of
   observations of the runs of the closed-loop system, which can be used
   for assisting the synthesis. We present a heuristic algorithm for the
   synthesis of covert damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of
   the plant and the (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into
   solving an instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis
   problem over certain surrogate plant. Due to the over-approximation
   involved in the surrogate plant, the heuristic is provably sound, but in
   general it is not complete. For simplicity, in this paper we only
   consider covert attackers that are able to carry out sensor replacement
   attacks and actuator disablement attacks.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the problem of synthesizing optimal
   control policies for stochastic control systems to achieve high-level
   temporal logic specifications under security constraints. Specifically,
   we consider a stochastic control system modeled by a finite labeled
   Markov Decision Process (MDP). We consider a passive intruder (an
   eavesdropper) that can observe the external output behavior of the
   system. We assume the system has a secret, modeled as visiting of some
   secret states, that does not want to be revealed to the intruder. The
   security constraint is that the intruder can never determine for sure
   that the system is/was at a secret state for any specific instant of
   time. The overall objective is to maximize the probability of achieving
   the temporal logic task while ensuring the information-flow security of
   the system. An effective algorithm is proposed to solve this problem.
   Specifically, we show that the security constraints can be handled as a
   safety requirement over the information-state-space and the optimal
   control problem can be solved by leveraging existing results from
   probabilistic model checking. The proposed approach is also illustrated
   by a case study for robot task planning.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with decentralized fault diagnosis for a discrete-event
   system that is observed at multiple observation sites through
   communication channels that can be attacked. The fault diagnosis
   architecture consists of a plant, local observation sites, and a
   coordinator that is responsible for ultimately diagnosing the faults
   occurring in the system, as well as communication channels between the
   various sensing devices and the local observation sites. An attacker,
   assumed to have full knowledge of the system model and ability to attack
   a subset of communication channels, aims to inhibit the ability of the
   coordinator to diagnose a fault. The type of attacks considered in this
   paper contain symbol insertion, symbol deletion, and symbol replacement
   attacks, each of which is associated with a positive cost (inversely
   correlated to the likelihood of the corresponding attack). A
   communication channel attack affects the outcome of a communication
   channel (from a sensing device to one of the observation sites) and
   results in a ``local{''} symbol insertion/deletion/replacement (i.e.,
   only the site associated with the communication channel under attack is
   affected). We describe a tamper-tolerant decentralized fault diagnosis
   protocol, which allows the coordinator to perform fault diagnosis
   despite the possible presence of attacks that are not greater than a
   certain total cost.},

Abstract = {Opacity is a property of information flow that characterizes the ability
   of a system to keep its secret information hidden from a third party
   called an attacker. In the state-of-the-art, opacity of Discrete Event
   Systems (DES) has been investigated using a variety of techniques.
   Methods based on Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) emerge as an efficient
   approach for enforcing this property. In this paper, we address the
   problem of enforcing the opacity of a DES through the definition of a
   supervisor whose role is to restrain the behavior of the system keeping
   ``good{''} runs only i.e., executions that exactly correspond to the
   opaque subset of the system's state space. The proposed approach is
   based on Symbolic Observation Graph: a hybrid graph where nodes are
   subsets of reachable states linked with unobservable actions. Encoding
   such nodes symbolically using binary decision diagrams allows to tackle
   the state space explosion problem.
   We designed a reduced-cost algorithm that synthesizes an optimal
   supervisor (at design time) to ensure the opacity of the system (at
   runtime). Moreover, we implemented our approach in C++ language and we
   validated our proposition using a real-life case study.},

Title = {Joint State Estimation Under Attack of Discrete Event Systems},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {168068-168079},
Abstract = {The problem of state estimation in the setting of partially-observed
   discrete event systems subject to cyber attacks is considered. An
   operator observes a plant through a natural projection that hides the
   occurrence of certain events. The objective of the operator is that of
   estimating the current state of the system. The observation is corrupted
   by an attacker which can tamper with the readings of a set of sensors
   thus inserting some fake events or erasing some observations. The aim of
   the attacker is that of altering the state estimation of the operator.
   An automaton, called joint estimator, is defined to describe the set of
   all possible attacks. In more details, an unbounded joint estimator is
   obtained by concurrent composition of two state observers, the attacker
   observer and the operator observer. The joint estimator shows, for each
   possible corrupted observation, the joint state estimation, i.e., the
   set of states consistent with the uncorrupted observation and the set of
   states consistent with the corrupted observation. Such a structure can
   be used to establish if an attack function is harmful w.r.t. a
   misleading relation. Our approach is also extended to the case in which
   the attacker may insert at most n events between two consecutive
   observations.},

Abstract = {System resilience captures the ability of the system to withstand a
   major disruption within acceptable performance degradation and to
   recover within an acceptable time frame. In this monograph we consider
   two possible sources of major disruptions, i.e., component faults and
   cyber intrusions. A component fault is an indigenous activity that
   renders unavailability or inaccessibility of certain functions within a
   component, either permanently or temporarily. It typically generates
   safety and performance concerns. Cyber intrusion on the other hand is an
   exogenous activity that tampers privacy, confidentiality, availability,
   or integrity of the system. These two sources are not always independent
   from each other. For example, a cyber intrusion may trigger a component
   fault, whereas a component fault may open a door for cyber intrusion,
   e.g., by keeping it undetected. For cyber intrusion, we will focus on
   opacity, which describes the system's ability to hide certain secrets
   from an external observer (or eavesdropper), and sensor and actuator
   attacks that exploit the system's existing controller to generate
   undesirable behaviours.
   In this monograph, we provide a detailed account of most recent research
   outcomes on fault diagnosis, opacity analysis and enhancement, and cyber
   security analysis and enforcement, within suitable discrete event system
   modelling frameworks. In each case, we describe basic problem statements
   and key concepts, and then point out the key challenges in each research
   area. After that, we present a thorough review of state-of-the-art
   techniques, and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we
   highlight key research directions for further exploration.},

Abstract = {To allow safe operation of an industrial control system under

   system that focuses on the attack resistance of its own detection

   composed of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for normal control and
   for fallback control. The normal PLC controls the field devices, and the
   fallback PLC takes over control after the normal PLC is attacked. This
   paper aims to model the system in terms of timed discrete event system
   and supervisory control theorem and realize the systematical fallback

Title = {Opacity of networked discrete event systems},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {543},
Pages = {328-344},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Opacity is an important information-flow property, which is used to
   characterize whether or not the secrets of system have been leaked to
   the intruders. Over the past ten years, opacity of discrete event
   systems (DESs) modeled as automata and Petri nets have been well
   investigated under the assumption that the communication channels
   between systems and intruders are perfect. However, in networked
   discrete event systems (NDESs), the DESs run in a shared network, and
   the communication delays and losses are inevitable usually. In this
   paper, we investigate the problems of opacity in the framework of NDESs.
   We formulate four kinds of opacity for NDESs, including current-state
   opacity, initial-state opacity, initial-final-state opacity, and K-step
   opacity. We also present the verification algorithms for these notions.
   We extend the notions of opacity in classical DESs, that is, if the
   communication delays and losses disappear, then these new notions would
   reduce to their classical counterparts. A number of examples are
   provided to illustrate the results obtained. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {A robust corrective control scheme is proposed for input/state
   asynchronous sequential machines (ASMs) vulnerable to an attacker that
   is able to switch actuator commands. We first present mathematical
   descriptions of the outcome of actuator attacks in the dynamics of ASMs,

   then address the existence condition and design algorithm for a
   corrective controller that overcomes any actuator attack in an

   fully utilized to surmount temporary corruption of actuator commands. An
   illustrative example is provided to show the proposed concept and

Abstract = {In cyber-physical systems (CPSs), it is of great importance to handle
   network attack issues. In this article, we consider the supervisory
   control layer of CPSs, focusing on closed-loop control systems
   vulnerable to sensor-reading modification attacks (SM-attacks), which
   may disguise the occurrence of an event as a different event by
   modifying appropriately sensor readings in sensor communication
   channels. In particular, we consider the plant modeled as a bounded
   Petri net and the control specification consisting in liveness
   enforcing. Based on repeatedly computing a more restrictive
   liveness-enforcing supervisor under no attack and constructing a
   so-called basic supervisor, a method that synthesizes a
   liveness-enforcing supervisor tolerant to an SM-attack is proposed.},

Abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) represents a backbone of modern
   reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS), which enable manufacturing
   of a high product variety through rapid and easy reconfiguration of
   manufacturing equipment. In IIoT-enabled RMS, modular equipment is built
   from smart devices, each performing its own tasks, whereas the global
   functioning is achieved through their networking and intensive
   communication. Although device communication contributes to the system
   reconfigurability, it also opens up new security challenges due to
   potential vulnerability of communication links. In this article, we
   present security analysis for a major part of RMS in which manufacturing
   equipment is sequentially controlled and can be modeled as discrete
   event systems (DES). Control distribution within DES implies
   communication of certain events between smart modules. Specifically, in
   this work, we focus on attacks on communication of these events. In
   particular, we develop a method for modeling such attacks, including
   event insertion and removal attacks, in distributed sequential control;
   the method is based on the supervisory control theory framework. We show
   how the modeled attacks can be detected and provide a method for
   identification of communication links that require protection to avoid
   catastrophic damage of the system. Finally, we illustrate and
   experimentally validate applicability of our methodology on a real-world
   industrial case study with reconfigurable manufacturing equipment.},

Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {128},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this paper, we tackle the performance safety enforcing problem in
   plants modeled by timed event graphs that are a subclass of timed Petri
   nets. We assume that a malicious intruder can increase the firing delay
   of transitions by adding delay in communication, or corrupt the
   transmitted data. Our target is to design a transition protecting policy
   to guarantee that the global performance does not drop below a given
   lower-bound threshold. Two classes of situations are considered: (1) the
   operator does not know the capability of the intruder, which means that
   all possible attacks must be taken into account; (2) the operator knows
   the upper bound of the capability of the intruder, e.g., the maximal
   number of transitions that can be simultaneously attacked. For the
   former case, we develop an algorithm using mixed integer linear
   programming to obtain an optimal protecting policy. For the latter
   situation, we develop a heuristic method to compute a protecting policy

Abstract = {Opacity is an important information-flow security property in the
   analysis of cyber-physical systems. It captures the plausible
   deniability of the system's secret behavior in the presence of an
   intruder that may access the information flow. Existing works on opacity
   only consider nonmetric systems by assuming that the intruder can always
   distinguish between two different outputs precisely. In this article, we
   extend the concept of opacity to systems whose output sets are equipped
   with metrics. Such systems are widely used in the modeling of many
   real-world systems whose measurements are physical signals. A new
   concept called approximate opacity is proposed in order to
   quantitatively evaluate the security guarantee level with respect to the
   measurement precision of the intruder. Then, we propose a new
   simulation-type relation, called approximate opacity-preserving
   simulation relation, which characterizes how close two systems are in
   terms of the satisfaction of approximate opacity. This allows us to
   verify approximate opacity for large-scale, or even infinite, systems
   using their abstractions. We also discuss how to construct approximate
   opacity-preserving symbolic models for a class of discrete-time control
   systems. Our results extend the definitions and analysis techniques for
   opacity from nonmetric systems to metric systems.},

Title = {Supervisory control of discrete-event systems under external attacks},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {562},
Pages = {398-413},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Resilience is a critical criterion to evaluate a networked system
   including discrete-event systems (DESs). This research touches upon the
   supervisory control problem of a DES modeled with labeled Petri nets
   under malicious attacks. Attacks on a system can be categorized into
   actuator attacks and sensor attacks. The former may cause a failure of
   an actuator for executing the commands issued from a supervisor that
   enforces a specification. The latter may corrupt an observation (i.e., a
   sequence of observable transition labels) from a sensor by different
   types of attacks such as insertion, removal, and replacement of
   transition labels. For actuator attacks, if we can detect them and
   disable some particular controllable transition labels before reaching a
   state that does not satisfy the specification, then we can find a
   modified supervisor to enforce the specification. For sensor attacks, we
   assume that, once a time, only one attack can be carried out, i.e., the
   attacker does not change the attack during an observation corruption.
   Given a specification, we consider in a plant model any two feasible
   transition sequences that share the same corrupted observation under
   attacks. It is shown that there exists a supervisor to enforce the
   specification if the one-step controllable extensions of the two
   transition sequences either satisfy or violate the specification
   simultaneously. To this end, a novel structure, namely a product
   observation reachability graph constructed from a plant and its
   specification, is proposed to decide the existence of such a supervisor
   by checking whether each state in the graph satisfies a particular
   condition. The application of the reported methods is demonstrated
   through examples.

Title = {Security of Cyber-Physical Systems: Design of a Security Supervisor to
   Thwart Attacks},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Abstract = {Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) integrate computing and communication
   capabilities to monitor and control physical processes. In order to do
   so, communication networks are commonly used to connect sensors,
   actuators, and controllers in the feedback system. The use of
   communication networks increases the vulnerability of CPSs to
   cyberattacks that can drive the system to unsafe states. One of the most
   powerful cyberattacks is the so-called man-in-the-middle attack, where
   the intruder can observe, hide, create, or change information in the
   attacked network channels. In this article, we propose a defense
   strategy that can thwart man-in-the-middle attacks in the sensor and/or
   control communication channels of CPSs modeled as discrete-event
   systems. We also introduce the definition of network attack security
   (NA-Security), which is related to the possibility of preventing the
   system from reaching unsafe states by using a security supervisor, whose
   online implementation has polynomial computational complexity, and we
   propose an algorithm to verify this property.},

Abstract = {Topics on security and privacy are very fundamental and important in the
   Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we explore the impact of state
   observation on the opacity of IoT, which is modeled by Moore-type finite
   state machine. Firstly, to characterize the intrusion estimator under
   the event-state observation, a multi-linear algebraic expression is
   proposed through the Boolean semi-tensor product (STP), and on the basis
   of the novel representation, the validation criterion is given by some
   matrix manipulations. Subsequently, considering that the input
   information may not be measured due to the physical shielding of the
   system against external intruders, we continue to discuss the opacity
   with state observation by a permutation structure matrix. Meanwhile, the
   verification of opacity with event-state observation is generalized to
   the one with only state observation. Finally, we offer an example to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed method. Taken
   together, the current results are helpful to provide a novel theoretical
   approach for investigating the privacy-preserving problem in the area of
   IoT and complex cyber-physical networks.},

Title = {Synthesis of covert actuator and sensor attackers},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {130},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this work, we shall investigate the problem of covert attacker
   synthesis in the framework of supervisory control of discrete-event
   systems. Intuitively, the covertness property says that the attacker
   cannot reach a situation where its existence has been detected by the
   supervisor while no damage can be caused. We consider covert attackers
   that can exercise both actuator attacks (including enablement attacks
   and disablement attacks) and sensor attacks (restricted to sensor
   replacement attacks), where the (partial-observation) attackers may or
   may not eavesdrop the control commands issued by the supervisor. We
   shall develop an exponential time reduction from the covert attacker
   synthesis problem to the well studied Ramadge-Wonham supervisor
   synthesis problem, which generalizes our previous work on a reduction
   based approach for covert actuator attacker synthesis, for both the
   damage reachable goal and the damage-nonblocking goal. We also provide
   discussions on conditions under which the exponential blowup in state
   sizes, due to the reduction construction, can be avoided. (C) 2021

Volume = {8},

Abstract = {In this article, we investigate security and privacy issues in networked
   supervisory control systems over multiple channel networks. We consider
   a networked discrete-event system controlled by a supervisor that
   receives information from sensors and sends control decisions to
   actuators via observation channels and control channels, respectively.
   The security problem is studied for the scenario where some of the
   communication channels are insecure in the sense there exists a passive
   intruder (eavesdropper) that can access the information-flow in those
   insecure communication channels. We adopt the concept of opacity, an
   information flow security property, to characterize the security status
   of the supervisory control system. Specifically, we assume that the
   system has a secret and the system is said to be opaque if the intruder
   can never determine the secret of the system unambiguously based on the
   information-flow in the insecure channels. We consider the notions of
   current-state opacity, K-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity in the
   networked control setting. New network observers are proposed to
   estimate the state of the system with two-side incomparable channel
   information. We show that the opacity verification problems for the
   networked setting can be effectively solved using the proposed network
   observers.},

Abstract = {In many security applications, system behaviors must be kept secret
   (opaque) to outside observers (intruders). Opacity was first studied for
   discrete event systems, and then it was extended to real-time systems.
   One of the challenges of real-time systems is the difficulty to
   guarantee their opacity against a potential attacker. In general, this
   property is undecidable for systems modeled by timed automata. A secret
   location, S, of a system is timed opaque to an intruder having partial
   observability of the system, if the intruder can never infer from the
   observation of any execution that the system has reached any secret
   location. In the present study, the static partial observability for
   systems modeled by nondeterministic timed automata is investigated.
   Thus, it focuses on systems where the timing of secret state
   reachability is bounded. The first contribution of this study is to
   define the bounded timed opacity property wherein, its complexity is
   proved. The second contribution is to consider systems where the secret
   should be kept hidden for a certain period referred to as the
   Delta-duration bounded opacity property. Also, a formal definition is
   proposed and its complexity is proved. In addition, the proposed
   properties are verified using timed bounded model checking. A case study
   ``Exchange in the Cloud system{''} is modeled by timed automaton to
   verify the proposed properties using SpaceEx tool.},

Abstract = {Security of distributed control systems is affected by the presence of
   information leaks, which permit to external intruders to infer the state

   system that presents information leaks, a supervisory control strategy
   to enforce noninterference is proposed in this article. The approach is
   based on the solution of optimization problems on a Petri net model of
   the system under investigation. The effectiveness of the proposed
   enforcement strategy is shown by means of illustrative examples.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we deal with current-state opacity, and propose an
   Opacity-Enforcer that is able to change, in an appropriate way, the
   order of observation of event occurrences in the system, and also to
   delete event observations, so as to mislead the Intruder to never be
   sure if the current state of the system is a secret state. We then
   present two necessary and sufficient conditions for the feasibility of
   current-state opacity enforceability (CSOE), i.e., if a current-state
   opacity enforcer that shuffles and deletes events can be synthesized for
   the system, and present an automaton-based verification test for CSOE
   and an algorithm to build the automaton that realizes the proposed
   opacity enforcement. We also present a protocol to mitigate the negative
   effect of opacity enforcement on the capability of a legitimate
   recipient to accurately estimate the current state of the system in the
   case when the information is also intended to be sent to some receiver
   that needs to be aware of the system evolution. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {Verification and enforcement of strong infinite- and k-step opacity
   using state recognizers},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {133},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this paper, we study the verification and enforcement problems of
   strong infinite-step opacity and k-step opacity for partially observed
   discrete-event systems modeled by finite state automata. Strong
   infinite-step opacity is a property such that the visit of a secret
   state cannot be inferred by an intruder at any instance along the entire
   observation trajectory, while strong k-step opacity is a property such
   that the visit of a secret state cannot be inferred within k steps after
   the visit. We propose two information structures called an 8-step
   recognizer and a k-step recognizer to verify these two properties. The
   complexities of our algorithms to verify strong infinite- and k-step
   opacity are O(2(2.vertical bar X vertical bar) . vertical bar E-o
   vertical bar) and O(2((k+2)) .vertical bar X vertical bar . vertical bar
   Eo vertical bar), respectively, which are lower than that of existing
   methods in the literature (vertical bar X vertical bar and vertical bar
   E-o vertical bar are the numbers of states and observable events in a
   plant, respectively). We also derive an upper bound for the value of k
   in strong k-step opacity, and propose an effective algorithm to
   determine the maximal value of k for a given plant. Finally, we note
   that enforcement of strong infinite- and k-step opacity can be
   transformed into a language specification enforcement problem and hence
   be solved using supervisory control. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Opacity, as an important security property, has been well investigated
   in crisp discrete event systems. However, in some practical systems, the
   general behaviors, secret and nonsecret behaviors obtained by the
   intruder need to be expressed as fuzzy sets rather than crisp sets.
   Under this situation, the intruder makes inferences by fuzzy logic
   rather than classic logic, thus the notions of the fuzzy opacity
   measures are desired to be established. First, by means of the basic
   laws of fuzzy logic, a general fuzzy opacity measure, as a template, is
   presented, in this article, for the given generalized characterizations
   of secret and nonsecret behaviors. Moreover, a specific measure, called
   as fuzzy initial-final opacity (FIFO) measure, is investigated under the
   assumption that the secrets and nonsecrets can be coded into the
   initial-final state-pairs. In addition, two variants of FIFO measure are
   also proposed under the assumptions that the secrets and nonsecrets are
   only related to the initial-states or final-states. With these fuzzy
   opacity measures, the system designers can evaluate the opacity degree
   of the systems to be designed. To show the applicability of the fuzzy
   opacity measures to practical systems, we finally present an
   illustrative example of evaluating the location privacy protection
   systems in location-based services by means of the fuzzy opacity
   measures.},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Non-interference in discrete event systems deals with the possibility by
   an intruder to infer the occurrences of private and non observable
   events, the so called high-level ones, by interacting with the system at
   a user level, i.e., by observing the occurrence of the so called
   low-level ones. When bisimulation non-interference is considered, the
   security objective is not only to avoid the detection of high-level
   event occurrences, but also to avoid the detection of their non
   occurrences; i.e., the secret includes also the non occurrences of some
   events. This letter deals with such a more restrictive security property
   in the framework of discrete event systems modelled as Petri nets. A
   necessary and sufficient condition is given to assess bisimulation
   non-interference in bounded Petri nets. Such a condition requires the
   solution of integer linear programming optimization problems, whose
   solution can be used also to statically enforce bisimulation
   non-interference when this condition is not satisfied by the original
   system.},

Title = {Usability aware secret protection with minimum cost},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {43},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In this paper we study a cybersecurity problem of protecting system's
   secrets with multiple protections and a required security level, while
   minimizing the associated cost due to implementation/maintenance of
   these protections as well as the affected system usability. The target
   system is modeled as a discrete-event system (DES) in which there are a
   subset of marker states denoting the services/functions provided to
   regular users, a subset of secret states, and multiple subsets of
   protectable events with different security levels. We first introduce
   usability-aware cost levels for the protectable events, and then
   formulate the security problem as to ensure that every system trajectory
   that reaches a secret state contains a specified number of protectable
   events with at least a certain security level, and the highest
   usability-aware cost level of these events is minimum. We first provide
   a necessary and sufficient condition under which this security problem
   is solvable, and when this condition holds we propose an algorithm to
   solve the problem based on the supervisory control theory of DES.
   Moreover, we extend the problem to the case of heterogeneous secrets
   with different levels of importance, and develop an algorithm to solve
   this extended problem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   solutions with a network security example. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Opacity is a security notion that focuses on determining whether a given
   system's behavior is kept secret to intruders. Various notions of
   opacity have received significant attention during the last decade
   including current state opacity and initial state opacity, which have
   been studied for deterministic and probabilistic systems in untimed
   contexts. In timed systems, opacity requirements may vary with time and
   one could also be interested in knowing the time duration for which
   opacity requirements are violated or preserved. The main contribution of
   this article is to introduce and analyze opacity exposure and opacity
   revelation times as measures of vulnerability in timed discrete event
   system (DES) that behave according to Markovian dynamics (i.e., at any
   given time, all enabled events are independent and distributed in time
   with exponential probability density functions). Labeled stochastic
   Petri nets (LSPNs) are used to model timed stochastic DESs, and
   appropriate constructions (involving current and initial state
   observers) are used to evaluate exposure and revelation times for a
   given LSPN.},

Abstract = {This work is set in the context of supervisory control of discrete-event
   systems under partial observation. Attackers that are able to insert or
   erase occurrences of particular output symbols can tamper with the
   supervisor's observation and by doing so, can lead the controlled system
   to undesirable states. We consider a scenario with multiple attackers,
   each one being an element of a set, called the attack set. We also
   assume that only one of the attackers within an attack set is acting,
   although we don't know which one. According to previous results in the
   literature, a supervisor that enforces a given legal language,
   regardless of which attacker is acting, can be designed if the legal
   language is controllable and satisfies a property called P-observability
   for an attack set. The latter is an extended notion of observability and
   is related with the supervisor's ability to always distinguish between
   outputs that require different control actions, even if the outputs were
   attacked. We present a new approach for checking if a given language is
   P-observable for an attack set, by first introducing a visual
   representation as well as some definitions that capture the attack's
   effect. Additionally, we present two algorithms that together allow us
   to verify if a given language is P-observable for an attack set, when it
   is represented as an automaton.},

Journal = {IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS},
Year = {2022},

Pages = {2930-2935},
Abstract = {The development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) has brought much
   attention of researchers to cyber-attack and cyber-security. A sensor
   attacker targeting on a supervised discrete event system can modify a
   set of sensor readings and cause the closed-loop system to reach
   undesirable states. In this letter, we propose a new attack detection
   mechanism under which the supervisor only needs to keep track of the
   last observable event received. Given a plant and a supervisor enforcing
   a state specification, we define a sensor attacker threatening if it may
   cause the closed-loop system to enter a forbidden state. Our goal is to
   verify whether there exists such a threatening sensor attacker for a
   given controlled system. A new structure, called All Sensor Attack
   (ASA), is proposed to capture all possible sensor attacks launched by
   the attacker. Based on the ASA automaton, a necessary and sufficient
   condition for the existence of a stealthy threatening sensor attacker is
   presented. Finally, we show that the condition can be verified in
   polynomial time.},

Title = {On Resilient Supervisory Control Against Indefinite Actuator Attacks in
   Discrete-Event Systems},
Journal = {IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {2942-2947},
Abstract = {In this letter we study a resilient supervisory control design problem
   in discrete-event systems. Consider that there are certain unsafe states
   in the system that must be prevented from entering, and this can be
   ensured by a supervisor disabling certain controllable events. Also
   consider that the system is subject to actuator attacks from intruders:
   some controllable events disabled by a supervisor may be re-enabled by
   an intruder. Our purpose is to address a challenging scenario where the
   controllable events that are vulnerable to attacks are indefinite, i.e.,
   any controllable event can be attacked. Associating to each unsafe state
   with a required safety level (a positive integer), our aim of this
   letter is to design a resilient supervisor such that for every unsafe
   state q, if the number of actuator attacks is no greater than the safety
   level of q, then the controlled system is guaranteed to avoid entering
   q. We first encode the behavior of the system under attack into an
   automaton called the resiliency automaton. We then show that the
   resilient supervisor synthesis problem may be cast into a supervisory
   control problem in the resiliency automaton. Hence, a maximally
   permissive resilient supervisor can be obtained by using the
   Ramadge-Wonham supervisory control paradigm. To the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first result on supervisory control design
   against indefinite actuator attacks in discrete-event systems.},

   Labeled Petri Nets},
Journal = {SCIENCE PROGRESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {105},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This work deals with the language-based opacity verification and
   enforcement problems in discrete event systems modeled with labeled
   Petri nets. Opacity is a security property that relates to privacy
   protection by hiding secret information of a system from an external
   observer called an ``intruder{''}. A secret can be a subset of a
   system's language. In this case, opacity is referred to as
   language-based opacity. A system is said to be language-based opaque if
   an intruder, with a partial observation on the system's behavior, cannot
   deduce whether the sequences of events corresponding to the generated
   observations are included in the secret language or not. We propose a
   novel and efficient approach for language-based opacity verification and
   enforcement, using the concepts of basis markings and basis partition.
   First, a sufficient condition is formulated to check language-based
   opacity for labeled Petri nets by solving an integer-programming
   problem. A unique graph, called a modified basis reachability graph
   (MBRG), is then derived to verify different language-based opacity
   properties. The proposed method relaxes the acyclicity assumption of the
   unobservable transition subnet thanks to the basis partition notion. A
   new embedded insertion function technique is also provided to deal with
   opacity enforcement. This technique ensures that no new observed
   behavior is created. A verification algorithm is developed to check the
   enforceability of a system. Finally, once a system is proved to be
   enforceable, an algorithm is given to construct a new structure, called
   an insertion automaton, which synthesizes all possible insertion
   functions that ensure opacity.},

Abstract = {Manufacturing systems may be subject to external attacks and failures,
   so it is important to deal with the recovery of the system after these
   situations. This article deals with the problem of recovering a
   manufacturing system, modeled as a discrete event system (DES) using the
   supervisory control theory (SCT), when the control structure, called
   supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical plant. The
   desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in
   uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if
   there is a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of
   each one of them, brings the system and supervisor back to a known
   state. The concepts of synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this
   article, we show under what conditions a set of synchronizing plants and
   specifications leads to a synchronizing supervisor obtained by the SCT.
   The problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a
   local recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model
   problems, composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata
   such that it is always possible do restore synchronization between the
   control (supervisor) and the plant. Note to Practitioners-Given the
   unpredictability of faults and malicious attacks occurring in industrial
   systems, recovery strategies are crucial for a harmonic operation of the
   plant. The possibility of leading the system to a known state,
   recovering control, is of extreme importance to the safety of industrial
   processes. The method proposed in this article uses well-known concepts
   of supervisory control theory (SCT) of discrete event systems (DESs),
   introducing the recovery process (using recovery events) in the modeling
   phase such that it is possible to isolate and fix only the part of the
   control system subject to the fault. The result of the proposed approach
   allows the implementation of such control system with the recovery
   procedure directly in the programmable logic controllers (PLCs).},

Abstract = {Privacy of distributed cyber-physical systems can be compromised by the
   presence of information leaks which permit to external intruders to
   infer the state of the system itself. These systems are built using
   several off-the-shelf components with communication capabilities that
   provide a significant level of control, and lower operational costs in
   comparison to the traditional vendor-specific proprietary and
   closed-source systems. However, these components expose the control
   systems to more vulnerabilities and threats. This work focuses on the
   multi-level intransitive non-interference, a property particularly
   suitable to tackle privacy problems of control systems under attack. The
   property is characterized and verified using Petri net models and
   mathematical programming.},

Title = {Modular Verification of Opacity for Interconnected Control Systems via
   Barrier Certificates},
Journal = {IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {890-895},
Abstract = {In this letter, we consider the problem of verifying initial-state
   opacity for networks of discrete-time control systems. We formulate the
   opacity property as a safety one over an appropriately constructed
   augmented system, and aim to verify this latter property by finding
   suitable barrier certificates. To reduce the computational complexity
   associated with computing barrier certificates for large networks, we
   propose a compositional approach to construct such barrier certificates
   for large-scale interconnected systems. This is achieved by introducing
   local barrier certificates for subsystems in the network and imposing
   some small-gain type conditions on the gains of those local barrier
   certificates. We also provide sufficient conditions for verifying the
   lack of opacity in large-scale networks by constructing barrier
   certificates ensuring some reachability properties over the augmented
   systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of our results, we consider the
   problem of tracking a target using a team of vehicles and verify if its
   initial position is secret from possible outside intruders.},

Abstract = {Opacity is an information flow property that captures the notion of
   plausible deniability in dynamic systems, that is whether an intruder
   can deduce that ``secret{''} behavior has occurred. In this paper we
   provide a general framework of opacity to unify the many existing
   notions of opacity that exist for discrete event systems. We use this
   framework to discuss language-based and state-based notions of opacity
   over automata. We present several methods for language-based opacity
   verification, and a general approach to transform state-based notions
   into language-based ones. We demonstrate this approach for current-state
   and initial-state opacity, unifying existing results. We then
   investigate the notions of K-step opacity. We provide a language-based
   view of K-step opacity encompassing two existing notions and two new
   ones. We then analyze the corresponding language-based verification
   methods both formally and with numerical examples. In each case, the
   proposed methods offer significant reductions in runtime and space
   complexity.},

Title = {Fuzzy Infinite-Step Opacity Measure of Discrete Event Systems and Its

Abstract = {Opacity is an important security notion for discrete event systems
   (DESs) to measure the secret behaviors leaked to an intruder. The
   intruder is usually modeled as a malicious observer who always attempts
   to infer secret behaviors based on his dynamical observations of the
   system. In our earlier research, we proposed several opacity measures
   for DESs from the perspective of fuzzy logic, in which the intruder is
   assumed to only infer the current secret behaviors. Considering that
   modern computers usually have a powerful computation ability and rich
   memory resources, this article presents a new opacity measure of DESs,
   called as fuzzy infinite-step opacity (FIO) measure, where the intruder
   is assumed to have the ability of inferring all the secret behaviors
   that occurred in the past. In addition, the properties and the
   calculation of the FIO measure are also investigated. The FIO measure
   can be used to assess the secret-leakage situations of fuzzy DESs
   attacked by powerful intruders. For the purpose of illustration, we
   present a practical application of the FIO measure in evaluating the
   privacy protection mechanisms in location-based services.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the robust control problem of discrete event
   systems assuming that replacement attacks may occur, thus making it
   appear that an event that has occurred looks like another event. In
   particular, we assume that this is done by tampering with the
   sensor-readings in the sensor communication channel. Specifically, we
   use Petri nets as the reference formalism to model the plant and assume
   a control specification in terms of a generalized mutual exclusion
   constraint. We propose three different methods to derive a control
   policy that is robust to the possible replacement attacks. The first two
   methods lead to an optimal (i.e., maximally permissive) policy but are
   computationally inefficient when applied to large-size systems. On the
   contrary, the third method computes a policy more efficiently and
   reveals more easily implementable in practice. However, this is done at
   the expense of optimality.},

Title = {Observation-assisted heuristic synthesis of covert attackers against
   unknown supervisors},
Journal = {DISCRETE EVENT DYNAMIC SYSTEMS-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS},
Abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of synthesis of covert attackers in
   the setup where the model of the plant is available, but the model of
   the supervisor is unknown, to the adversary. To compensate the lack of
   knowledge on the supervisor, we assume that the adversary has recorded a
   (prefix-closed) finite set of observations of the runs of the
   closed-loop system, which can be used for assisting the synthesis. We
   present a heuristic algorithm for the synthesis of covert
   damage-reachable attackers, based on the model of the plant and the
   (finite) set of observations, by a transformation into solving an
   instance of the partial-observation supervisor synthesis problem. The
   heuristic algorithm developed in this paper may allow the adversary to
   synthesize covert attackers without having to know the model of the
   supervisor, which could be hard to obtain in practice. For simplicity,
   we shall only consider covert attackers that are able to carry out
   sensor replacement attacks and actuator disablement attacks. The
   effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on a water tank example
   adapted from the literature.},

Title = {Symbolic Verification of Current-State Opacity of Discrete Event Systems
   Using Petri Nets},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN CYBERNETICS-SYSTEMS},
Abstract = {Given a discrete event system, it is said to be opaque if an intruder
   who can partially observe system behavior cannot infer that the system
   is necessarily in a predefined secret. A discrete event system is
   current-state opaque if an intruder is never able to verify whether the
   current state of the system is within the secret states. This article
   addresses the verification of current-state opacity of a discrete event
   system modeled with Petri nets, where the secret is defined as a set of
   states. The existing methods cannot deal with large-sized systems due to
   the curse of dimensionality. Multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs) are
   widely accepted as an efficient and compact data structure for
   representing the extremely large reachability sets of Petri nets. We
   show that MDDs can be used in Petri nets with partial observable
   transitions and propose an approach for the verification of
   current-state opacity for bounded Petri nets. It is shown by
   experimental studies that the symbolic approach is practically more
   efficient than traditional techniques such as basis reachability graphs
   (BRGs).},

   problem is the fact that cyber attacks can cause significant damage to
   industrial systems, and thus has gained increasing attention from
   researchers and practitioners. This paper presents a survey of
   state-of-the-art results of cyber attacks on cyber physical systems.
   First, as typical system models are employed to study these systems,
   time-driven and event-driven systems are reviewed. Then, recent advances
   on three types of attacks, ie., those on availability, integrity, and
   confidentiality are discussed. In particular, the detailed studies on
   availability and integrity attacks are introduced from the perspective
   of attackers and defenders. Namely, both attack and defense strategies
   are discussed based on different system models. Some challenges and open
   issues are indicated to guide future research and inspire the further
   exploration of this increasingly important area.},

Title = {Robust decentralized diagnosability of networked discrete event systems
   against DoS and deception attacks},
Journal = {NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {44},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Denial-of-Service (DoS) are attacks conducted by malicious agents that
   consists in disrupting, temporally or indefinitely, the services
   provided by a communication network. When a malicious agent gets access
   to some network node, it may also perform deception attacks by inserting
   valid packets with fake information into vulnerable channels. We
   address, in this paper, DoS and deception attacks (DoS-D attack) that
   flood some communication channels with fake packets causing delays, loss
   of observations and insertion of fake observations, and their
   implications in decentralized fault diagnosability of networked discrete
   event systems (NDES). To this end, we propose an automaton model for
   NDES subject to DoS-D attacks that represents the adverse effects of
   DoS-D attacks on the observations of local diagnosers. We introduce a
   new codiagnosability definition called DoS-D-robust codiagnosability,
   and present a necessary and sufficient condition for a language to be
   DoS-D-robustly codiagnosable. We also propose a verification algorithm
   for regular languages to check DoS-D-robust codiagnosability. (c) 2022

Title = {Security-preserving multi-agent coordination for complex temporal logic
   tasks},
Journal = {CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {123},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This paper investigates the coordination of multiple agents for
   high-level tasks described by linear temporal logics (LTL). The general
   purpose for multi-agent coordination is to synthesize a plan such that
   the LTL task is achieved optimally. In addition to the standard
   requirement on the correctness of the plan, we further investigate the
   potential information leakage of each agent during the operating
   process. Specifically, we consider the scenario where the behavior of
   each individual agent is partially monitored by a passive intruder
   modeled as an outside observer or an eavesdropper. The security
   constraint requires that the intruder can never identify for sure that
   some specific individual agent is carrying out some sub-tasks of
   significant importance. To this end, we model the mobile capability of
   the agent team by a global labeled transition system. To describe
   information-flow security constraint, motivated by the generic notion of
   opacity, two different types security requirements are proposed for each
   individual agent. An effective coordination algorithm is proposed that
   synthesizes an optimal global plan for the entire agent team such that
   the global LTL task can be achieved, while the security of each
   individual agent is preserved. The proposed framework is implemented in
   real-world experiment and is also demonstrated by several case studies.},

Abstract = {In this article, we study a security problem of protecting secrets in
   discrete-event systems modeled by deterministic finite automata. In the
   system, some states are defined as secrets, each of which is associated
   with a security level. The problem is to design an event-protecting
   policy such that any event sequence from the initial state that reaches
   a secret state contains a number of protected events no less than the
   required level of security. To solve this secret securing problem, we
   first develop a layered structure called the security automaton. Then,
   we show that the problem is transformed to a supervisory control problem
   in the security automaton. We consider two criteria of optimality on
   protecting policies: 1) disruptiveness, i.e., protecting policies with a
   minimum degree of disturbance to legal users' normal operations; and 2)
   cost, i.e., protecting policies with a minimal cost. For the optimality
   on disruptiveness, we prove that a minimally disruptive protecting
   policy is obtained by using the classical supervisory control theory in
   the security automaton. For the optimality on cost, we develop a method
   to obtain a protecting policy with minimal cost by finding a min-cut in
   the security automaton.},

Abstract = {In this article, we study the security of control systems in the context
   of the supervisory control layer of stochastic discrete-event systems.
   Control systems heavily rely on correct communication between the plant
   and the controller. In this article, we consider that such communication
   is partially compromised by a malicious attacker. The attacker has the
   ability to modify a subset of the sensor readings and mislead the
   supervisor, with the goal of inducing the system into an unsafe state.
   We consider this problem from the attacker's viewpoint and investigate
   the synthesis of an attack strategy for systems modeled as probabilistic
   automata. Specifically, we investigate the synthesis of attack functions
   constrained by multiple objectives. We proceed in two steps. First, we
   quantify each attack strategy based on the likelihood of successfully
   reaching an unsafe state. Based on this quantification, we study the
   problem of synthesizing attack functions with the maximum likelihood of
   successfully reaching an unsafe state. Second, we consider the problem
   of synthesizing attack functions that have the maximum likelihood of
   successfully reaching an unsafe state while minimizing a cost function,
   i.e., the synthesis of attack functions is constrained by multiple
   objectives. Our solution methodology is based on mapping these problems
   to optimal control problems for Markov decision processes, specifically,
   a probabilistic reachability problem and a stochastic shortest path
   problem.},

Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {140},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Opacity is an important information security property. Given a discrete
   event system, a set of secret states, and an intruder who observes the
   system evolution through an observation mask, the system is said to be
   K-step opaque if the intruder is not able to ascertain that the system
   is or was in a secret state at some time within K steps, namely within
   the observation of K events. If the intruder is never able to ascertain
   that the system is or was in a secret state at any time, the system is
   said to be infinite-step opaque. This work aims at verifying the two
   opacity properties when the discrete event system is modeled as a
   bounded labeled Petri net. Using the notion of basis reachability graph,
   new approaches are proposed to check K-step opacity and infinite-step
   opacity. The proposed approaches are shown to be more efficient than the
   standard methods based on the reachability graph. (C)\& nbsp;2022

Title = {A framework for current-state opacity under dynamic information release
   mechanism},
Journal = {AUTOMATICA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {140},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {ABSTR A C T Opacity is an important information-flow security property
   that characterizes the plausible deniability of a dynamic system for its
   ``secret `` against eavesdropping attacks. As an information-flow
   property, the underlying observation model is the key in the modeling
   and analysis of opacity. In this paper, we investigate the verification
   of current-state opacity for discrete-event systems under Orwellian-type
   observations, i.e., the system is allowed to re-interpret the
   observation of an event based on its future suffix. First, we propose a
   new Orwellian-type observation model called the dynamic information
   release mechanism (DIRM). In the DIRM, when to release previous ``hold
   on `` events is state-dependent. Then we propose a new definition of
   opacity based on the notion of history-equivalence rather than the
   standard projection-equivalence. This definition is more suitable for
   observations that are not prefix-closed. Finally, we show that by
   constructing a new structure called the DIRM-observer, current-state
   opacity can be effectively verified under the DIRM. Computational
   complexity analysis as well as illustrative examples for the proposed
   approach is also provided. Compared with the existing Orwellian-type
   observation model, the proposed framework is more general in the sense
   that the information-release-mechanism is state-dependent, information
   is partially released and the corresponding definition of opacity is
   more suitable for non-prefix-closed observations. (C)\& nbsp;2022

Title = {Active opacity of discrete-event systems},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL},
Abstract = {As an essential attribute of information flow, opacity is used to
   characterise whether or not the intruders can infer the system secrets,
   which has caused considerable concern. For a complex system with
   multiple secret states, it is difficult to ensure the system opacity,
   which makes it necessary to actively control the system to enforce their
   opacity. In this regard, based on the framework of partially observable
   and controllable discrete event system, the active current-state opacity
   is studied. The system being actively opaque means that we can find a
   control for each secret state such that the behaviour of system reaching
   the secret state is opaque. Under such control, the intruder is unable
