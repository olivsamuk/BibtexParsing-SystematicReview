abstract = {Duplicate Address Detection is the protocol that confirms the uniqueness of an IPv6 host′s identification when it joins a new network. DAD scheme is susceptible to neighbor advertisement and neighbor solicitation spoofing attacks because ICMPv6 control messages lack in authentication. Existing strategies against the DAD attack have major drawbacks, e.g., high computation, non-scalability, requirement of protocol modification etc. This paper presents a strategy for detecting DAD attack using Conjunctive Normal Form-based Discrete Event System diagnoser. DES-based intrusion detection system have shown effective results in terms of features, like no change in protocol, low overhead etc. against network attacks. The primary drawback of the DES-based IDS is the diagnosis process, which necessitates synchronization of two or more state-based models, making it computationally expensive. To address this issue, CNF-based DES diagnoser scheme is proposed that has all the advantages of DES-based IDS and at the same time addresses the complexity issues. The CNF diagnoser also facilitates the diagnosability verification. The proposed CNF-based IDS for DAD attack is implemented in a testbed and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness in terms of minimal resource consumption, 100% accuracy, high detection rate, less processing time and low traffic overhead.}

abstract = {Opacity is an important system-theoretic property expressing whether a system may reveal its secret to a passive observer (an intruder) who knows the structure of the system but has only limited observations of its behavior. Several notions of opacity have been discussed in the literature, including current-state opacity, k-step opacity, and infinite-step opacity. We investigate weak and strong k-step opacity, the notions that generalize both current-state opacity and infinite-step opacity, and ask whether the intruder is not able to decide, at any time instant, when respectively whether the system was in a secret state during the last k observable steps. We design a new algorithm verifying weak k-step opacity, the complexity of which is lower than the complexity of existing algorithms and does not depend on the parameter k, and show how to use it to verify strong k-step opacity by reducing strong k-step opacity to weak k-step opacity. The complexity of the resulting algorithm is again better than the complexity of existing algorithms and does not depend on the parameter k.}

abstract = {Opacity, as an important property in information-flow security, characterizes the ability of a system to keep some secret information from an intruder. In discrete-event systems, based on a standard setting in which an intruder has the complete knowledge of the system’s structure, the standard versions of current-state opacity and initial-state opacity cannot perfectly characterize higher-level privacy requirements. To overcome such a limitation, in this paper we propose two stronger versions of opacity called strong current-state opacity and strong initial-state opacity for partially-observed nondeterministic finite-state automata. Strong current-state (resp., initial-state) opacity describes that for each run of a system ending (resp., starting) at a secret state, there exists a non-secret run whose observation is the same as that of the previous run. Then we propose an information structure using a novel concurrent-composition technique to verify strong current-state opacity and strong initial-state opacity, which has time complexity O((|Σ||X|2+|Σo||X∖XS|2(1+|Σuo|))2|X∖XS|), where |X| (resp., |Σ|, |Σo|, |Σuo|, |X∖XS|) is the number of states (resp., events, observable events, unobservable events, non-secret states) of an automaton. Finally, the proposed information structure is also used to check strong infinite-step opacity, which has lower time complexity than the previous one in the literature.}

abstract = {Opacity is a property of discrete event systems (DES) that is related to the possibility of hiding a secret to external observers, the so called intruders. If the secret is the system initial state, then the related opacity problem is referred to as Initial State Opacity (ISO). This paper gives a necessary and sufficient condition to check ISO in DES modeled as bounded and live labeled Petri nets (PNs). The proposed approach relies on both the algebraic representation of labeled PNs dynamic, and on their structural representation in terms of minimal support T-invariants. The proposed necessary and sufficient condition enables ISO assessment by means of the solution of Integer Linear Programming problems, which can be efficiently solved nowadays by means of off-the-shelf optimization tools.}

Building upon existing works on optimal supervisor synthesis, on one hand, and the base model construction in the transformation of covert sensor–actuator attacker synthesis to supervisor synthesis, on the other hand, we show how the optimal covert sensor–actuator attacker synthesis problem could be transformed to the optimal supervisor synthesis problem, thus generalizing its logic counterpart. We consider several different types of optimization objectives, such as (1) minimization of attack energy cost, and (2) minimization of time cost to cause damage infliction; for the latter one, asynchronous event firings and concurrent event firings at the plant are both considered. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an optimal attacker for both the energy minimization case and damage infliction time minimization case. Thus, this work may potentially provide a unified approach for the optimal synthesis of covert sensor–actuator attackers in different setups.}

abstract = {One of the most important challenges for the application of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in smart industries is ensuring its security against cyber attacks. In this paper, we consider that the CPS is abstracted as a Discrete-Event System (DES), and we consider cyber attacks where the intruder eavesdrops the communication channels from the system to an intended receiver (e.g. a supervisor or diagnoser) to detect the occurrence of a sequence in the secret behavior of the system. In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message. A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property. We also present a method to create an encryption function to ensure confidentiality for a CPS, if it exists, when the secret language is formed only of sequences with length bounded by a given number.}

abstract = {We consider feedback control systems where sensor readings and actuator commands may be compromised by an attacker intending to damage the system. We study this problem at the supervisory layer of the control system, using discrete event systems techniques. The attacker can edit the outputs from the sensors of the system before they reach the supervisory controller as well as it can edit actuator commands before they reach the system. In this context, we formulate the problem of synthesizing a supervisor that is robust against a large class of edit attacks on the sensor readings and actuator commands. Intuitively, we search for a supervisor that guarantees the safety of the system even when sensor readings and actuator commands are compromised. Given the similarities of the investigated problem to the standard supervisory control problem, our solution methodology reduces the problem of synthesizing a robust supervisor against deception attacks to a supervisory control problem. This new and intuitive solution methodology improves upon prior work on this topic.}

abstract = {Cybersecurity of discrete event systems (DES) has been gaining more and more attention recently, due to its high relevance to the so-called 4th industrial revolution that heavily relies on data communication among networked systems. One key challenge is how to ensure system resilience to sensor and/or actuator attacks, which may tamper data integrity and service availability. In this paper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks. We first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the existence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand–supply relationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set of risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the attacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the latter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string to happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor attack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are regular, it is possible to remove all such risky pairs from the plant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to establish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor resilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of its kind in the DES literature on cyber attacks. The proposed decision process renders a specific synthesis procedure that guarantees to compute a resilient supervisor whenever it exists, which so far has not been achieved in the literature.}
