abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined routing protocols for low power and lossy networks (RPL) for constrained devices. RPL constructs DODAGs (destination oriented directed acyclic graphs), to optimize routing. RPL ensures acyclic topology with the DODAG version number. However, the control message&rsquo;s DODAG version number is not authenticated. So, RPL is vulnerable to network resource attack known as DODAG Version Number (DVN) attack. DVN attack creates a packet delay, packet loss, cyclic topology, etc., in the network. This paper proposes a method for detecting DODAG version number attacks. Several existing schemes to defend against the DVN, such as cryptographic techniques, trust-based, threshold-based and mitigation are computationally intensive or require protocol modification. DVN does not change the packet format or sequence of packets, but can still perform attacks and hence fall under the category of stealthy attacks, which are difficult to detect using traditional intrusion detection system&rsquo;s (IDS). Discrete-event system (DES) based IDS have been applied in the literature for stealthy attacks that achieve low overhead, low false alarm rate, etc. However, the construction of DES-based IDS for network protocol may lead to errors, as modelling is manual. The resulting IDS, therefore, is unable to guarantee its correctness. This paper proposes linear temporal logic (LTL) based DES paradigm to detect DVN. LTL-based paradigm facilitates formal verification of the DES-based IDS, and hence the correctness of the scheme is ascertained. The proposed technique is simulated using the Contiki cooja simulator. When the percentage of spiteful nodes in the network increases, the true positive rate, and packet delivery rate drops, while the false positive rate and control message overhead increase. The memory requirement for sending the packets and verifying the nodes is minimal. The LTL-based IDS has been formally verified using NuSMV to ensure the correctness of the framework.<br/></div> &copy; 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">Duplicate Address Detection is the protocol that confirms the uniqueness of an IPv6 host<sup>&prime;</sup>s identification when it joins a new network. DAD scheme is susceptible to neighbor advertisement and neighbor solicitation spoofing attacks because ICMPv6 control messages lack in authentication. Existing strategies against the DAD attack have major drawbacks, e.g., high computation, non-scalability, requirement of protocol modification etc. This paper presents a strategy for detecting DAD attack using Conjunctive Normal Form-based Discrete Event System diagnoser. DES-based intrusion detection system have shown effective results in terms of features, like no change in protocol, low overhead etc. against network attacks. The primary drawback of the DES-based IDS is the diagnosis process, which necessitates synchronization of two or more state-based models, making it computationally expensive. To address this issue, CNF-based DES diagnoser scheme is proposed that has all the advantages of DES-based IDS and at the same time addresses the complexity issues. The CNF diagnoser also facilitates the diagnosability verification. The proposed CNF-based IDS for DAD attack is implemented in a testbed and experimental results illustrate the effectiveness in terms of minimal resource consumption, 100% accuracy, high detection rate, less processing time and low traffic overhead.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {<div data-language="eng" data-ev-field="abstract">One of the most important challenges for the application of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in smart industries is ensuring its security against cyber attacks. In this paper, we consider that the CPS is abstracted as a Discrete-Event System (DES), and we consider cyber attacks where the intruder eavesdrops the communication channels from the system to an intended receiver (e.g. a supervisor or diagnoser) to detect the occurrence of a sequence in the secret behavior of the system. In order to prevent the attacker from discovering secret information from the communication channel, a new cryptographic scheme based on events, called event-based cryptography, is introduced. We also define the property of confidentiality of DES with respect to an encryption function and a secret language, which is associated with the fact that only the sender and the intended receiver are able to understand the transmitted secret message. A necessary and sufficient condition for confidentiality is presented, and we propose a test to verify this property. We also present a method to create an encryption function to ensure confidentiality for a CPS, if it exists, when the secret language is formed only of sequences with length bounded by a given number.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

For this purpose, the considered system is assumed to be abstracted as a discrete event system. Labeled finite automata with inputs are used to model the system's behavior along with the information that circulates in both the input and output channels. In particular, we study here stealthy, i.e., undetectable, cyber-attacks that aim to drive the system from a given normal state to a set of forbidden states. We assume that the attacker has limited resources, i.e., a credit, to insert and delete control and sensors events. The proposed analysis evaluates the costs of such attacks on the controlled system depending on its structure, the cost of the malicious actions and possible uncertainties that may affect those costs. It provides systematic methods that aim to compute attacks of minimal cost and robust attacks that are weakly impacted by uncertainties. A case study representing a manufacturing plant is considered to illustrate the results.<br/></div> &copy; 2016 IEEE.},

For a complex system with multiple secret states, it is difficult to ensure the system opacity, which makes it necessary to actively control the system to enforce their opacity. In this regard, based on the framework of partially observable and controllable discrete event system, the active current-state opacity is studied. The system being actively opaque means that we can find a control for each secret state such that the behaviour of system reaching the secret state is opaque. Under such control, the intruder is unable to confirm the current state as secret state through limited observation. We construct an active-opacity verifier and derive a necessary and sufficient condition to check the active opacity of the system.<br/></div> &copy; 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This work studies the verification problem of critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets. The proposed method is a two-fold process: a preliminary verification of critical observability for the underlying logic labeled Petri net and a further verification considering the time constraint associated with each transition. The first step is based on the concurrent composition of a reachability graph of the logic net. If the logic net is critically observable, then the time net is also critically observable at any given time instant. Otherwise, the second step is to design an algorithm to compute all pairs of transition-class sequences that violate critical observability at the given time instant, and then a set of linear programming problems is exploited to check critical observability for the corresponding timed system. Note to Practitioners-Timed discrete event systems provide a theoretical model for safety-critical real applications such as air traffic management, smart grid, and industrial control, which are vulnerable to malicious attack and destruction at some particular time instants such that a system may be misled to dangerous states. Critical observability of a timed discrete event system is a property with which the predefined dangerous states can be determined and detected from the observation by an observer at a given time instant. This research aims to offer a systematic approach to check critical observability for timed discrete event systems modeled by bounded labeled time Petri nets, which can also present some new ideas and insights for practitioners in the field of safety-critical systems.<br/></div> &copy; 2004-2012 IEEE.},
